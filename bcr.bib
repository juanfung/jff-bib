A comprehensive review on strengthening techniques and implications for the seismic behavior is made. Different strengthening schemes are implicitly simulated within equivalent frame models of the representative buildings. Then, pushover analysis is applied in order to compare the seismic performance of the buildings, before and after strengthening. A cost-benefit analysis of the strengthening solutions is finally performed, comparing the economic benefit gained by reducing the seismic damage, against the intervention cost.},

The primary objective of the study aims to support, motivate, and encourage the decision makers, owners, investors, and concerned stakeholders to invest money for retrofitting of existing seismic deficient buildings. The study also aims to identify the best retrofit technique through the comparison of cost-benefit ratio. For this, the study investigates four existing buildings, representing two buildings for each non-engineered and pre-engineered design approaches. The selected non-engineered buildings were built in late 90's and pre-engineered buildings between late 90's to 2015. After rigorous analysis, it was revealed that the unexpected losses (in terms of monetary values) could be minimized by large extents, i.e. (2-11) times for non-engineered and (3-50) times for engineered buildings with the intervention of retrofit strategies. The attained expected annual loss for as-built and retrofit buildings evaluated through discrete distribution as a function of two intensity measures reveals that the maximum expected annual loss ensues between 0.1g and 0.2 g {PGA} for non-engineered buildings and below 0.1 g {PGA} for pre-engineered buildings. A higher cost-benefit ratio value can be attained if the service life of the building structure is increased or decreased discount rate. For most of the studied buildings, buildings retrofitted with {RC} shear wall found to be the most economically viable, and followed by steel bracing and jacketing, respectively.},

The analyses are underpinned by building motion-damage relationships developed based on observed damage in past earthquakes in California and New Zealand. The considered upgrading measures ranged from parapet bracing to comprehensive seismic upgrades consistent with local practices. Parapet bracing and other partial retrofits were shown to have favorable benefit-cost ratios and thus be strong candidate measures for risk mitigation programs. Full upgrades were shown to have less favorable benefit-cost ratios. While applied to Victoria, the generality of the methodology and the use of observed damage data from California and New Zealand make the findings of this study particularly relevant for similar locations throughout the Pacific Northwest and abroad.},

Regulators frequently face a risk-benefit trade-off since zero risk is neither practicable nor affordable. Although it is accepted that cost–benefit analysis is important in many scenarios of risk management, what role it should play in a decision process is still controversial. One criticism of cost–benefit analysis is that decision makers should consider marginal benefits and costs, not present ones, in their decision making. In this paper, we investigate the problem of regulatory decision making under risk by applying expected utility theory and present a new approach of cost–benefit analysis. Directly taking into consideration the reduction of the risks, this approach achieves marginal cost–benefit analysis. By applying this approach, the optimal regulatory decision that maximizes the marginal benefit of risk reduction can be considered. This provides a transparent and reasonable criterion for stakeholders involved in the regulatory activity. An example of evaluating seismic retrofitting alternatives is provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.},

A standardized and straightforward risk assessment methodology is needed for public authorities in moderate seismic / high vulnerability areas to assess the potential seismic risks and to make corresponding structural strengthening plans for protecting properties and people's lives. Adopting the standardized seismic loss assessment tool {HAZUS}, this study aims to present the methodology for investigating the economic feasibility of the pre-earthquake structural strengthening of buildings by means of benefit-cost analysis. Therefore, the specific objectives of this study are to: (1) to assess the seismic risks with building and demography parameters which can fully represent the characteristic of local built environment, (2) to conduct benefit-cost analysis of the seismic mitigation activities, and (3) to verify the applicability of the present methodology by a case study. To assess risk from earthquake hazards, both deterministic and probabilistic earthquake scenarios were simulated, combined with micro-zoning studies, geological characteristics, building inventories, population distribution, and adaptation of the building fragility curves and casualty matrix to the local conditions. This study intends to provide public decision makers a standardized methodology for justifying the economic feasibility of seismic risk mitigation alternatives so that a cost-efficient public earthquake mitigation strategy can be achieved.},

This paper present a procedure whose results allow to give a simple answer to the above question, central in earthquake engineering and, in a broader context, in any man-made activity. The procedure uses, as a starting point, the results of a standard reliability analysis conducted on the structure in its present state and after retrofitting. Once these are known, expressed in terms of mean rate of exceedance of specified limit states, it is shown that it is possible to compute whether the upgrading should be made after all and how convenient it is. The assumptions to make the problem tractable are clearly listed and appear, in the authors’s viewpoint, quite reasonable. The final results are presented both in diagrams and with a simple formula. The method is finally applied to two cases, already studied and presented by the authors, which had been developed up to the computations of the mean rate of failure: bridges on an Italian highway stretch (Donferri et al.

	abstract = {The residential sector accounts for approximately one fifth of Canada's secondary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, addressing the energy efficiency of residential buildings has a significant role to play in reducing the nation's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Ontario Building Code has recently been updated to reflect a more stringent energy performance standard. A home built to the prescribed minimum requirements will perform at a relatively high standard with respect to energy use when compared to homes built less than a decade ago. This paper explores three energy efficiency upgrade options which improve upon the energy efficiency of the 2012 Ontario Building Code. The “controlled ventilation” upgrade involved tightening up the building envelope and adding heat recovery to waste air streams, and two additional upgrade options were developed to meet the high performance targets of the R-2000 standard. While the upgrades explored did not show financial benefit for individual homeowners at current utility rates, if the benefits to society are considered, the upgrades are an economically efficient method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions owed to energy consumption. In addition to highlighting the need for a broader approach to the cost-benefit analyses associated with these types of upgrades, this finding also warrants a discussion about how to transform the current housing market so that energy efficient homes are more appropriately valued.},

	abstract = {In this study, multiple performance objectives under the various earthquake hazard levels are investigated. In case of well defined earthquake hazard, as an alternative of classical earthquake resistant design principles, it is possible to design structures at different performances depending on structure's initial cost and economic life. In this study, costs of the structure with different performance levels are discussed.Current study is carried out on the reinforced concrete structures that are designed and analyzed for various seismic hazard levels. The aim is to determine, if the risk is released, whether the economic losses can be acceptable or not. In the study, cost of reinforced concrete ductile frames and dual systems that are designed for various seismic performances, are also compared for the economical aspects.To that end, in the first step 3, 5 and 8 storey frames and dual systems of several structures at Life Safety and Immediate Occupancy performance levels was designed for the earthquake hazards of 2\% and 10\% probability of exceedance in 50 years. The study reveals that if both direct and indirect effects of earthquake such as retrofitting costs, cost of temporary moving, temporary accommodation costs, cost of demolition and reconstructing the building, cost of damage to household goods and business disruption, social disturbance, are be taken into consideration, initial design performance level can be accepted as Immediate Occupancy performance level rather than Life Safety performance which is proposed current earthquake codes.

They advocated such basic empirical practices as making observations at all, doing so systematically and routinely, and recording data at the time of observation. By 1912, performance measurement exhibited many of the features associated with the modern practice: measuring of input, output, and results; attempting to make government more productive; making reports comparable among communities; and focusing on allocation and accountability. Performance measurement was developed in the context of shifting power between the elected executive and the legislature.},

To this purpose contemporary decision making tools, namely cost-benefit and life-cycle cost analyses, are tailored to the needs of the present study, and implemented with the aid of an ad-hoc developed new software application ({COBE}06). A method for estimating the reduction in structural vulnerability due to retrofit is proposed, as well as a methodology to determine the optimum retrofit level using the fragility curve approach. Finally, the proposed methodology is used in a pilot application that concerns the city of Thessaloniki, and results are drawn for the feasibility of strengthening the reinforced concrete building stock in this city.},

Moreover, the predictive modeling approach provides a measure of uncertainty in terms of prediction error.

A specific catastrophic risk model has been developed to evaluate, building by building, the probabilistic losses and pure premiums of different portfolios, taking into account the seismic microzonation of cities. This model has been used to evaluate the fiscal contingency liabilities of the government and to build an optimal structure for risk transfer and retention, considering contingent credits, reserve funds, insurance/reinsurance, and cat bonds. Lastly, the model allows the evaluation of an exceedance probability curve of benefit-cost ratio, providing an innovative and ground-breaking tool for decision makers to analyze the net benefits of the risk mitigation strategies, such as earthquake retrofitting and seismic code enforcement.

Productivity in these sectors is found to be anything but stagnant, having increased 1.7 percent annually from 1967 to 1981 and 3.0 percent annually from 1977 through 1981.},

	abstract = {Cost-benefit assessment is used to evaluate the effectiveness of various seismic retrofit strategies to address concerns about earthquake safety and damage to older concrete frame buildings. The benefits of mitigation are quantified in monetary terms by assessing the reductions in risk of building damage (repairs) and occupant fatalities. When evaluated considering repair costs only, the maximum cost of retrofitting that offers a positive rate of return is 10\% to 30\% of the building replacement value. Since seismic retrofits generally cost more than this, this result suggests that reduced risk of damage and repairs alone does not warrant the expense of retrofitting. However, the added benefits of reduced fatality risks would make retrofitting cost-effective if it costs as much as 60\% of the building replacement cost. The cost-benefit approach provides an important tool to evaluate the merits of seismic mitigation in light of competing demands for finite public and private resources.},

	abstract = {A seismic risk assessment is often performed on behalf of a buyer of commercial buildings in seismically active regions. One outcome of the assessment is that a probable maximum loss ( {PML}) is computed. {PML} is of limited use to real-estate investors as it has no place in a standard financial analysis and reflects too long a planning period. We introduce an alternative to {PML} called probable frequent loss ( {PFL}), defined as the mean loss resulting from shaking with 10\% exceedance probability in 5 years. {PFL} is approximately related to expected annualized loss ( {EAL}) through a site economic hazard coefficient (H) introduced here. {PFL} and {EAL} offer three advantages over {PML}: (1) meaningful planning period; (2) applicability in financial analysis (making seismic risk a potential market force); and (3) can be estimated using a single linear structural analysis, via a simplified method called linear assembly-based vulnerability ({LABV}) that is presented in this work. We also present a simple decision-analysis framework for real-estate investments in seismic regions, accounting for risk aversion. We show that market risk overwhelms uncertainty in seismic risk, allowing one to consider only expected consequences in seismic risk. We illustrate using 15 buildings, including a 7-story nonductile reinforced-concrete moment-frame building in Van Nuys, California, and 14 buildings from the {CUREE}-Caltech Woodframe Project.},

Impact is assessed by applying a hedonic model to microlevel data, and this process also addresses spatial dependency. While our findings suggest that designated landmarks do not sell at a premium or discount, landmarks are found to have positive external effects on surrounding property prices within a distance of approximately 600 m.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse two questions. First, is there, and if so, how large is the price premium paid for a building exhibiting a cultural value? Second, are there any spillover effects of buildings with cultural values on sales prices of neighbouring houses? Design/methodology/approach Using a unique database of all buildings in the region of Halland, Sweden, combined with transaction data, hedonic models can be estimated, with spatially lagged variables describing proximity to three classes of culturally classified building – A, B and C – corresponding to building of national interest, building of regional interest and building of local interest. In addition, the authors also estimate models with a spatial specification on the error term, in an attempt to control for omitted variables. Findings The results indicate that cultural classification plays a role in determining the price of a property, with large effects (ranging between 36 and 60\% price premiums) for the highest classification. In addition, the authors find evidence of a cultural externality, houses in the vicinity of building with high cultural value sell at a small, but statistically significant premium of 1\%. Originality/value The cultural externality may be overlooked when it comes to valuation of cultural values in society, and therefore, it is likely that warranted protection acts to preserve cultural values in buildings become less than the social optimum. This paper suggests a new measure to cultural values contrasting previous research that rely on cultural preservation. This approach should limit problems with measurement errors that may lead to biased results.},
