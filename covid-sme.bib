	abstract = {Society is increasingly focused on resilience to catastrophic events. Firms generally observe two forms of economic disruption, property damage and business interruption ({BI}). In contrast to pre-event mitigation intended primarily to avoid property damage, firms can use a variety of resilience tactics once the disaster strikes to reduce {BI} losses by improving stability and continuity of operations. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by incorporating resilience into longstanding economic production theory and by identifying the key components for evaluating the cost and effectiveness of resilience. It also makes important empirical contributions by designing, administering, and analyzing surveys of firms affected by two of the most devastating disasters in {US} history. This paper is the first to econometrically analyze these production theory relationships, identifying the cost-effectiveness of a full range of explicit resilience tactics. Results show that {BI} losses exceeded property damage losses by over 900\% and, on average, firms avoided \$4.57 in {BI} for every dollar spent on resilience. Generalizable comparative static estimates are presented for the manufacturing sector to test formalized relationships, which identify that tactics capable of improving factor productivity can significantly enhance the cost-effectiveness of resilience.},

We conduct a longitudinal qualitative study, collecting data from 35 small business owner-managers between April and December 2020. Our findings—which provide insights into the micro-underpinnings of the resilience exhibited by small business in response to the {COVID}-19 pandemic—illustrate the responses and resilient qualities of owner-managers at both the personal and leadership levels, which facilitate resilient actions at the small business level. By drawing on a psychological perspective, our study provides a novel conceptualization of small business resilience at the person-role-organization nexus.},

For example, the literature suggests that resilience in organisations is influenced by factors of various levels, occurring at both the individual and organisational level. However, there are currently few insights into how these different levels of analysis interact with each other. Therefore, focusing on resilience in the context of entrepreneurship, this paper aims to explore the relationship between the employee-level resilience dimensions (cognitive, behavioural and contextual) and entrepreneurs’ perceived performance, and the moderating role of entrepreneur resilience. A survey has been conducted with 195 entrepreneurs managing small family firms. Results confirm the hypothesis that the dimensions of employee-level resilience affect performance positively when the entrepreneur has a strong propensity towards personal resilience. Entrepreneurs may use these insights to increase awareness of their actions towards achieving organisational resilience and to implement practices aimed at increasing employee-level resilience.},

Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with key regional stakeholders, the article reveals how peripheral post-industrial places are constrained by their histories. This is found to be manifest in different ways, such as low aspirations, generational unemployment and a loss of identity which are in turn compounded by negative perceptions of place and opportunity. These issues culminate in institutional hysteresis at the local level and constrain entrepreneurial ambition. The article argues that the rigidity and reproduction of informal institutions continues to stymie economic resilience and growth. We conclude by reflecting on the implications for entrepreneurship in peripheral post-industrial places as well as with recommendations for policy.},

	abstract = {We examine the impact of two common methods of internal restructuring, layoffs and divestitures on the survival of a sample of {UK} firms. Using a Poisson regression model, we find that divestitures improve survival likelihood by reducing the probability and speed of market exit via takeover or bankruptcy, whereas layoffs increase the probability and speed of market exit via bankruptcy. Surprisingly, classifying firms into financially distressed and healthy groups, we find that distressed firms are less likely to restructure. Furthermore, while divestitures improve survival likelihood in both groups, layoff firms are less likely to survive, irrespective of whether they are distressed or healthy. Our findings are consistent with event studies that examine the market reaction to layoffs and divestiture decisions, and so provide some support for the view that the market correctly values the consequences of these restructuring actions on firm survival. The results are robust to several econometric and modeling issues, including controlling for potential self-selection bias.},

The level of research interest may stem from the fact that in the {US}, only about half of all new small businesses survive after 4 years (Headd 2003). However, research attempting to understand the phenomenon that employs data using only information from and about surviving firms may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the factors that influence firm survival and failure. In this paper, we provide evidence that omitted information about the firms that disappear from the research data over time leads to biased coefficient estimates. Comparing the Heckman two-step estimation approach of switching regression models to a semi-parametric Cox hazard model, the Accelerated Failure Time ({AFT}) model, we conclude that the Cox {ATF} approach is the most appropriate model for firm survival analysis.},

	abstract = {Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to "the" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to "robust" covariance matrix estimation  -  applicable beyond lm() and glm()  -  is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in {vcovCL}(), {vcovPL}(), and {vcovPC}(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in {vcovBS}(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including {MASS}, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates the cost of the lockdown of some sectors of the world economy in the wake of {COVID}-19. We develop a multi sector disequilibrium model with buyer-seller relations between agents located in different countries. The production network model allows us to study not only the direct cost of the lockdown but also indirect costs which emerge from the reductions in the availability of intermediate inputs. Agents determine the quantity of output and the proportions in which to combine inputs using prices that emerge from local interactions. The model is calibrated to the world economy using input-output data on 56 industries in 44 countries including all major economies. Within our model, the lockdowns are implemented as partial reductions in the output of some sectors using data on sectoral decomposition of capacity reductions. We use computational experiments to replicate the temporal sequence of the lockdowns implemented in different countries. World output falls by 7\% at the early stage of the crisis when only China is under lockdown and by 23\% at the peak of the crisis when many countries are under a lockdown. These direct impacts are amplified as the shock propagates through the world economy because of the buyer-seller relations. Supply-chain spillovers are capable of amplifying the direct impact by more than two folds. Naturally, the substitutability between intermediate inputs is a major determinant of the amplification. We also study the process of economic recovery following the end of the lockdowns. Price flexibility and minor technological adaptations help in reducing the time it takes for the economy to recover. The world economy takes about one quarter to move towards the new equilibrium in the optimistic and unlikely scenario of the end of all lockdowns. Recovery time is likely to be significantly greater if partial lockdowns persist.},

Here, we analyse the supply-chain effects of a set of idealized lockdown scenarios, using the latest global trade modelling framework. We find that supply-chain losses that are related to initial {COVID}-19 lockdowns are largely dependent on the number of countries imposing restrictions and that losses are more sensitive to the duration of a lockdown than its strictness. However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A ‘go-slow’ approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns. Regardless of the strategy, the complexity of global supply chains will magnify losses beyond the direct effects of {COVID}-19. Thus, pandemic control is a public good that requires collective efforts and support to lower-capacity countries.},

This study focuses on supply chains, or supplier–customer networks of firms and examines how these supply chains enable production losses caused by natural disasters to propagate and persist in regions not directly affected by the disaster. We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6\% of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5\%). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.},

We find that in low-income countries, a lockdown can potentially lead to 1.76 children’s lives lost due to the economic contraction per {COVID}-19 fatality averted. The ratio stands at 0.59 and 0.06 in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries, respectively. As a result, in some countries lockdowns actually can produce net increases in mortality. The optimal lockdowns are shorter and milder in poorer countries than in rich ones, and never produce a net mortality increase.},

	abstract = {As a way of slowing {COVID}-19 transmission, many countries and U.S. states implemented shelter-in-place ({SIP}) policies. However, the effects of {SIP} policies on public health are a priori ambiguous as they might have unintended adverse effects on health. The effect of {SIP} policies on {COVID}-19 transmission and physical mobility is mixed. To understand the net effects of {SIP} policies, we measure the change in excess deaths following the implementation of {SIP} policies in 43 countries and all U.S. states. We use an event study framework to quantify changes in the number of excess deaths after the implementation of a {SIP} policy. We find that following the implementation of {SIP} policies, excess mortality increases. The increase in excess mortality is statistically significant in the immediate weeks following {SIP} implementation for the international comparison only and occurs despite the fact that there was a decline in the number of excess deaths prior to the implementation of the policy. At the U.S. state-level, excess mortality increases in the immediate weeks following {SIP} introduction and then trends below zero following 20 weeks of {SIP} implementation. We failed to find that countries or U.S. states that implemented {SIP} policies earlier, and in which {SIP} policies had longer to operate, had lower excess deaths than countries/U.S. states that were slower to implement {SIP} policies. We also failed to observe differences in excess death trends before and after the implementation of {SIP} policies based on pre-{SIP} {COVID}-19 death rates.},

	abstract = {Many non-experimental studies use propensity-score methods to estimate causal effects by balancing treatment and control groups on a set of observed baseline covariates. Full matching on the propensity score has emerged as a particularly effective and flexible method for utilizing all available data, and creating well-balanced treatment and comparison groups. However, full matching has been used infrequently with binary outcomes, and relatively little work has investigated the performance of full matching when estimating effects on binary outcomes. This paper describes methods that can be used for estimating the effect of treatment on binary outcomes when using full matching. It then used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these methods based on full matching (with and without a caliper), and compared their performance with that of nearest neighbour matching (with and without a caliper) and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The simulations varied the prevalence of the treatment and the strength of association between the covariates and treatment assignment. Results indicated that all of the approaches work well when the strength of confounding is relatively weak. With stronger confounding, the relative performance of the methods varies, with nearest neighbour matching with a caliper showing consistently good performance across a wide range of settings. We illustrate the approaches using a study estimating the effect of inpatient smoking cessation counselling on survival following hospitalization for a heart attack.},

	abstract = {Modern survey methods may be subject to non-observable bias, from various sources. Among online surveys, for example, selection bias is prevalent, due to the sampling mechanism commonly used, whereby participants self-select from a subgroup whose characteristics differ from those of the target population. Several techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. One such is Propensity Score Adjustment ({PSA}), which is widely used and has been analysed in various studies. The usual method of estimating the propensity score is logistic regression, which requires a reference probability sample in addition to the online nonprobability sample. The predicted propensities can be used for reweighting using various estimators. However, in the online survey context, there are alternatives that might outperform logistic regression regarding propensity estimation. The aim of the present study is to determine the efficiency of some of these alternatives, involving Machine Learning ({ML}) classification algorithms. {PSA} is applied in two simulation scenarios, representing situations commonly found in online surveys, using logistic regression and {ML} models for propensity estimation. The results obtained show that {ML} algorithms remove selection bias more effectively than logistic regression when used for {PSA}, but that their efficacy depends largely on the selection mechanism employed and the dimensionality of the data.},

This approach uses demographic and additional so-called Webographic or lifestyle variables to balance observed differences between Web survey respondents and phone survey respondents. Here the authors investigate some of the Webographic questions used by Harris Interactive, a commercial company specializing in Web surveys. Their Webographic questions include choice of activities such as reading, sports and traveling and perceptions about what would constitute a violation of privacy. They use data from an existing probability sample of respondents over 40 who are interviewed over the phone, and a corresponding sample of respondents interviewed over the Web. They find that Webographic questions differentiate between on and offline populations differently than demographic questions. In general, propensity score adjustment of variables in the Web survey works quite well for a number of variables of interest (including home ownership and labor force participation). For two outcomes, (having emotional problems and often experiencing pain) the process of adjusting for demographic variables leads to the discovery of an instance of Simpson's paradox, implying a differential mode effect or differential selection. They interpret this mainly as the result of a mode effect, where sensitive questions are more likely to receive a positive response over the Internet than over the phone.},

The web survey used a statistical technique, propensity scoring, to adjust for selection bias. Comparing the weighted responses from both surveys, there were no significant response differences in 8 of 37 questions. Web survey responses were significantly more likely to agree with {RDD} responses when the question asked about the respondent’s personal health (9 times more likely), was a factual question (9 times more likely), and only had two as opposed to multiple response categories (17 times more likely). For three questions, significant differences turned insignificant when adjacent categories of multicategory questions were combined. Factual questions tended to also be questions with two rather than multiple response categories. More study is needed to isolate the effects of these two factors more clearly.},

Survey data have been used to a lesser extent to examine plausible causal relationships between variables, perhaps due to the increased likelihood of selection bias that results with nonexperimental data. In this article, we use National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study data to demonstrate the use of inverse probability of treatment weighting, a quasi-experimental methodology based on propensity scores that can be used to reduce selection bias and examine plausible causal relationships.

What is less well understood is the extent to which the observed patterns of travel behavior can be attributed to the residential built environment itself, as opposed to the prior self-selection of residents into a built environment that is consistent with their predispositions toward certain travel modes and land use configurations. To date, most studies addressing this attitudinal self-selection issue fall into seven categories: direct questioning, statistical control, instrumental variables models, sample selection models, joint discrete choice models, structural equations models, and longitudinal designs. This paper reviews and evaluates these alternative approaches with respect to this particular application (a companion paper focuses on the empirical findings of 28 studies using these approaches). We identify some advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and note the difficulties in actually quantifying the absolute and/or relative extent of the true influence of the built environment on travel behavior. Although time and resource limitations are recognized, we recommend usage of longitudinal structural equations modeling with control groups, a design which is strong with respect to all causality requisites.},

Study Design Using simulation, we compared the following methods for estimating the treatment effect: a naïve estimate (ignoring both survey weights and propensity scores), survey weighting, propensity score methods (nearest neighbor matching, weighting, and subclassification), and propensity score methods in combination with survey weighting. Methods are compared in terms of bias and 95 percent confidence interval coverage. In Example 2, we used these methods to estimate the effect on health care spending of having a generalist versus a specialist as a usual source of care. Principal Findings In general, combining a propensity score method and survey weighting is necessary to achieve unbiased treatment effect estimates that are generalizable to the original survey target population. Conclusions Propensity score methods are an essential tool for addressing confounding in observational studies. Ignoring survey weights may lead to results that are not generalizable to the survey target population. This paper clarifies the appropriate inferences for different propensity score methods and suggests guidelines for selecting an appropriate propensity score method based on a researcher's goal.},

This application has a rich sampling design; the Internet sample is part of an existing probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study, that is representative of the U.S. population aged 50 and older. For the dichotomous variables investigated, the adjustment helps. On average, the sample means in the Internet access sample differ by 6.5 percent before and 3.7 percent after adjustment. Still, a large number of adjusted estimates remain significantly different from their target estimates based on the complete sample.

In terms of sample selection, the type of access to internet surveys has several limitations. There are internet surveys based on restricted access and on voluntary participation, and these are characterized by their implementation according to the type of survey. It can be used probability and non-probability sampling, both of which may lead to biased estimates.

	abstract = {At first sight, web surveys seem to be an interesting and attractive means of data collection. They provide simple, cheap, and fast access to a large group of potential respondents. However, web surveys are not without methodological problems. Specific groups in the populations are under-respresented because they have less access to Internet. Furthermore, recruitment of respondents is often based on self-selection. Both under-coverage and self-selection may lead to biased estimates. This paper describes these methodological problems. It also explores the effect of various correction techniques (adjustment weighting and use of reference surveys). This all leads to the question whether properly design web surveys can be used for data collection. The paper attempts to answer this question. It concludes that under-coverage problems may solve itself in the future, but that self-selection leads to unreliable survey outcomes. A première vue, les enquêtes en ligne semble être un moyen intéressant et attrayant de collecte de données. Ils fournissent un accès simple, rapide et peu coûteux à un grand groupe de répondants potentiels. Les enquêtes en ligne ne sont toutefois pas sans problèmes méthodologiques. Certains groupes au sein des populations sont sous-représentés parce qu'ils ont un accès restreint à Internet. En outre, le recrutement des personnes interrogées est souvent fondé sur l'auto-sélection. Sous-couverture et auto-sélection peuvent toutes deux être la source d' estimations biaisées. Le présent article décrit ces problèmes méthodologiques. Il explore également l'effet des différentes techniques de correction (pondération corrective et utilisation d'enquêtes de référence). Tout ceci amène à la question de savoir si des enquêtes en ligne bien conçues sont propres à être utilisées pour la collecte de données. L'article tente de répondre à cette question. Il conclut que le problème de la sous-couverture pourrait se résoudre dans l'avenir, mais que l'auto-sélection aboutit à des résultats d'enquête non fiables.},

This paper provides the first analysis of impacts of the pandemic on the number of active small businesses in the United States using nationally representative data from the April 2020 Current Population Survey—the first month fully capturing early effects. The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22\% over the crucial 2‐month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African‐American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41\% drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32\%, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26\%. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36\%. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25\% drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low—down by 15\% and 8\%, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries. These findings of early‐stage losses to small business activity have important implications for policy, income losses, and future economic inequality.},

	abstract = {We consider several economic uncertainty indicators for the {US} and {UK} before and during the {COVID}-19 pandemic: implied stock market volatility, newspaper-based policy uncertainty, Twitter chatter about economic uncertainty, subjective uncertainty about business growth, forecaster disagreement about future {GDP} growth, and a model-based measure of macro uncertainty. Four results emerge. First, all indicators show huge uncertainty jumps in reaction to the pandemic and its economic fallout. Indeed, most indicators reach their highest values on record. Second, peak amplitudes differ greatly – from a 35\% rise for the model-based measure of {US} economic uncertainty (relative to January 2020) to a 20-fold rise in forecaster disagreement about {UK} growth. Third, time paths also differ: Implied volatility rose rapidly from late February, peaked in mid-March, and fell back by late March as stock prices began to recover. In contrast, broader measures of uncertainty peaked later and then plateaued, as job losses mounted, highlighting differences between Wall Street and Main Street uncertainty measures. Fourth, in Cholesky-identified {VAR} models fit to monthly U.S. data, a {COVID}-size uncertainty shock foreshadows peak drops in industrial production of 12–19\%.},

	abstract = {To explore the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID}-19) on small businesses, we conducted a survey of more than 5,800 small businesses between March 28 and April 4, 2020. Several themes emerged. First, mass layoffs and closures had already occurred—just a few weeks into the crisis. Second, the risk of closure was negatively associated with the expected length of the crisis. Moreover, businesses had widely varying beliefs about the likely duration of {COVID}-related disruptions. Third, many small businesses are financially fragile: The median business with more than \$10,000 in monthly expenses had only about 2 wk of cash on hand at the time of the survey. Fourth, the majority of businesses planned to seek funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ({CARES}) Act. However, many anticipated problems with accessing the program, such as bureaucratic hassles and difficulties establishing eligibility. Using experimental variation, we also assess take-up rates and business resilience effects for loans relative to grants-based programs.},
