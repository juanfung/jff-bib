The rational component of downtime is evaluated based on the results of probabilistic seismic loss assessment analyses, using suitable time estimating manuals for civil construction works. The irrational component of downtime is derived from empirical data relevant to post-earthquake reconstruction in Italy. Suitable criteria are then adopted to monetize the downtime for indirect loss estimation. Finally, a simplified model, expressing indirect monetary loss as a function of the earthquake intensity level, is tentatively proposed, to be incorporated in practice-oriented procedures for the estimation of the expected annual loss of residential {RC} buildings.},

	abstract = {A simulation-based model designed to conduct in-event simulation for the assessment and quantification of seismic resilience of communities is presented. The proposed simulation approach employs a dynamic analysis that models the behavior of the community at each time step as the seismic event occurs (time step in seconds) and as the community recovers after the event (time step in days). The dynamic nature of the analysis permits explicit consideration of in-event interdependencies that can arise between the physical (i.e., buildings-related) and social (i.e., injured people-related) systems of the community and provides detailed information about the temporal and spatial distribution of injuries/fatalities during the seismic hazard. The proposed model is modularized into independent simulators that model different aspects of the studied scenario, including the city layout, seismic hazard, community losses, and physical and social recovery trajectories. The capability of the proposed simulation model to support hazard mitigation planning was demonstrated through a case study that showed the trade-off between physical and social costs of various feasible mitigation strategies.},

	abstract = {Modeling the recovery process of a community’s infrastructure after the occurrence of extreme events is now at the forefront of research. Estimating post-disaster recovery of either single or multiple infrastructure in a community requires proper flow and interaction of information of the physical, economic and social components of the involved sectors. Understanding this recovery process is essential, particularly for critical infrastructure, such as a hospital, which is vital for a community’s well-being. In this study, the full seismic functionality and recovery process of a six-story hospital, located in Memphis, {TN}, is quantified and assessed using a comprehensive 3-D finite element model with soil-structure interaction. The hospital functionality assessment encompasses both the quantity and the quality of the hospitalization service. To account for hospital dependency on other infrastructure during the recovery process, a virtual community is assumed, and five additional lifelines are included in the analysis. The model accounts for limitation in resources within the community, expected economic return for each lifeline, and interdependencies between the different lifelines. The introduced framework is implemented using data gathered from historical earthquakes as well as assumed data as needed. Recoveries of the different lifelines are estimated using continuous Markov chain process, where the community resources are distributed among the different lifelines using dynamic optimization to either obtain the most economic return for the whole community or the fastest recovery of the hospital. In addition, the effect of including infrastrcture interdependence on the recovery of the hospital is evaluated. The results are further utilized to estimate the seismic resilience of the hospital.},

	abstract = {The increased frequency and magnitude of natural and anthropogenic hazard events that affected infrastructure systems over the past two decades have highlighted the need for more effective risk management strategies. Such strategies are expected to not only manage the immediate disruption to system’s functionality following hazard realization, but to also mitigate the latter’s extended-term consequences (e.g., recovery cost and restoration time), which would otherwise be disastrous. To yield realistic managerial insights, such resilience-guided risk management necessitates accounting for the different sources of uncertainties associated with both the hazard quantification and the response of the infrastructure being considered. Through considering such uncertainties, the probabilistic resilience quantification framework developed in this study is expected to provide valuable managerial insights to guide resource allocations for both pre- and posthazard realization. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated on a simplified system subjected to different anthropogenic hazard scenarios. Beyond the presented case study, the developed framework lays the foundation for adopting probabilistic resilience quantification to guide the next-generation risk management processes of infrastructure systems under different forms of natural and anthropogenic hazards.},

Nevertheless, there lack appropriate quantitative assessment approaches of hospital earthquake resilience, which makes it challenging for devising and benchmarking resilience enhancement measures. In this paper, a quantitative assessment approach of hospital resilience to earthquakes considering the physical damage and the recovery of hospital functionality is proposed. A system dynamics ({SD}) model is developed to simulate the hospital functionality hence enabling quantification of hospital resilience to earthquakes. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated in a case study. The proposed approach can provide a tool for hospitals to quantitatively assess their resilience to earthquakes so as to propose targeted resilience enhancement measures for future earthquakes.},

Observations of damage to several residential structures and one commercial building were made in the immediate aftermath of the tornado. These observations were used to compare the performance of the engineered commercial building and residential structures in the same area. The conclusions made from the observations described in this paper are anecdotal and based on a limited amount of data, but indicate that residential structures constructed using the building code improvements made in Moore, Oklahoma, in 2014 perform as expected when subjected to the winds associated with an {EF}2 tornado.

Existing scales commonly used in resilience analysis are designed to measure damage and do not resolve functionality, the stated metric of most resilience models. The structural functionality of a building is defined as the ability of the building to provide the primary function as a shelter. Total functionality for a building includes additional nonstructural components, such as electric power, water, and transportation access. The structural functionality scale for light-framed wood buildings is designed to measure structural functionality directly. A set of structural functionality indicators for wind-damaged buildings provides a metric with distinguishable discrete indicators on the continuous structural functionality scale. The structural functionality indicators were designed to provide compatibility with existing scales related to wind damage. General guidelines for similarly metered indicators on the structural functionality scale provide a basis for measuring the impact of other hazards. The structural functionality scale and indicators provide a reference for comparison between resilience models and allow empirical measurements of structural functionality and resilience. Once adopted in conceptual resilience models, the structural functionality scale will provide a basis for validation with empirical measures.},

	abstract = {A number of high-profile seismic events have occurred in recent years, with a wide variation in the resulting economic damage and loss of life. This variation has been attributed in part to the stringency of seismic building codes implemented in different regions. Using the {HAZUS} Earthquake Model, a benefit–cost analysis was performed on varying levels of standard buildings codes for Haiti and Puerto Rico. The methodology computes expected loss assuming a Poisson event process with lognormally distributed event magnitude and idealized damage–magnitude response functions. The event frequency and magnitude distributions are estimated from the historical record, while the damage functions are fit using {HAZUS} simulation results for events with systematically varying magnitudes and different seismic code levels. To validate the approach, a single-event analysis was conducted using alternative building codes and mean magnitude earthquakes. A probabilistic analysis was then used to evaluate the long-term expected value for alternative levels of building codes. To account for the relationship between lives saved and economic loss, the implicit cost of saving a life is computed for each code option. It was found that in the two areas studied, the expected loss of life was reduced the most by use of high seismic building code levels, but lower levels of seismic building code were more cost-effective when considering only building damages and the costs for code implementation. The methodology presented is meant to provide a basic framework for the future development of an economic-behavioral model for code adoption.},

The conceptual model can be operationalized to create a numerical model of recovery. To demonstrate this, we present a prototype computer simulation model and graphical user interface. As the model is intended for decision support, it is important to involve potential users in model development. We conducted a focus group involving Puget Sound, Washington, area disaster management practitioners to elicit local insight about community recovery and model development needs, using the prototype as stimulus.

However, the recovery process of a community building portfolio as a spatially distributed system is intrinsically complex and highly uncertain, and is conditional on the resourcefulness and social-economic characteristics of the community as well as the various decisions made by numerous community stakeholders and building owners at different phases of the recovery. We propose a simulation-based building portfolio recovery model ({BPRM}) to predict the functionality recovery time and recovery trajectory of a community building portfolio following natural scenario hazard events, in two steps: (1) modeling individual building-level restoration as a discrete state, continuous time Markov Chain ({CTMC}); and (2) modeling building portfolio-level recovery through aggregating the {CTMC} restoration processes of individual buildings across the domain of the community and over the entire recovery time horizon. We propagate uncertainties associated with the recovery process in a consistent manner in order to quantify portfolio recovery metrics probabilistically.

	abstract = {A framework is presented for incorporating probabilistic building performance limit states in the assessment of community resilience to earthquakes. The limit states are defined on the basis of their implications to postearthquake functionality and recovery. They include damage triggering inspection, occupiable damage with loss of functionality, unoccupiable damage, irreparable damage, and collapse. Fragility curves are developed linking earthquake ground motion intensity to the probability of exceedance for each of the limit states. A characteristic recovery path is defined for each limit state on the basis of discrete functioning states, the time spent within each state, and the level of functionality associated with each state. A building recovery function is computed accounting for the uncertainty in the occurrence of each recovery path and its associated limit state. The outcome is a probabilistic assessment of recovery of functionality at the building level for a given ground motion intensity. The effects of externalities and other socioeconomic factors on building-level recovery and ways to incorporate these in the framework are discussed. A case study is presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework to model the postearthquake recovery of the shelter-in-place housing capacity of an inventory of residential buildings. This type of assessment can inform planning and policy decisions to manage the earthquake risk to residential housing capacity of communities.},

The effect of several mitigation strategies that involve replacing portions of the existing building stock with an enhanced seismic performance system is evaluated. The impact on community resilience is assessed based on the immediate and cumulative loss of permanent housing occupancy as well as the time to recover some fraction of the pre-earthquake housing capacity. The results show how the slope of the recovery curve for occupiable housing during different periods following the event can be linked to the distribution of building damage. In addition to limiting major damage, enhanced building seismic performance is shown to reduce aggregate losses over the recovery period, thereby having a significant effect on both the safety and resilience of residential communities.},

Building functionality is jointly affected by both the structural integrity of the building itself and the availability of critical utilities. To this end, the framework incorporates three analyses for a given earthquake scenario: (1) evaluation of the spatial distribution of physical damages to both buildings and utility infrastructure; (2) computation of utility disruptions deriving from the cascading failures occurring in interdependent utility networks; and (3) by integrating the results from the first two analyses, making a probabilistic prediction of the postevent functionality loss of building portfolios at the community scale. The framework couples the functionality analyses of physical systems of distinct topologies and hazard response characteristics in a consistent spatial scale, providing a rich array of information for community hazard mitigation and resilience planning. An implementation of the {BPFL} framework is illustrated using the residential building portfolio in Shelby County, Tennessee, subjected to an earthquake hazard.},

	abstract = {Resilience of buildings in the face of earthquakes and wind is not explicitly addressed by current building codes and standards, but the importance of a building’s ability to bounce back in the face of these hazards and become functional soon after is gaining more interest. Given that the East and West Coasts of the United States pose different earthquake and wind hazards, evaluation of code-designed buildings in these two regions can provide much needed insight into the level of multihazard resilience they possess. This paper evaluates the resilience of two 7-story reinforced concrete moment frame buildings designed by current codes and standards in two cities: Boston and San Francisco. By employing new and existing models for hazard, demand, and capacity, and accounting for uncertainty, the cost and loss of function resulting from wind and earthquake hazards over the life of these two buildings are assessed. Deformation demand on structural framing, interior partitions, and the building envelope is evaluated using nonlinear time history analysis under a suite of ground motions in San Francisco and using a new approach based on modal analysis in Boston. Performance of envelope components under extreme wind conditions is evaluated by considering the effects of wind pressure as well as windborne debris impact. Building resilience is then assessed in terms of estimated repair cost and loss of function over the life of the building. It is discussed that unrepairable damage from permanent drift is an important factor for resilience because it contributes significantly to expected repair cost and loss of function. For wind hazard, it is shown that damage to flat roof covering is not a significant contributor to building resilience in either location. Furthermore, the need for having impact resistance design of glazing is discussed because the associated repair cost and loss of function are considerable.},

	abstract = {Building seismic performance plays an important role in earthquake resilience. This role can be characterized beyond safety and collapse prevention, which are the primary building code objectives, by evaluating the loss of function and costs of repair of buildings. One important measure for building performance evaluation is the damage that occurs when structural and nonstructural elements are deformed beyond their capacity during an earthquake. Through a risk-based performance evaluation procedure, the expected impact of changes in stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity on building damage can be quantified and the results can be utilized to make targeted improvements to building codes to enhance earthquake resilience. In this paper, models of 4, 7, 10, and 15-story reinforced concrete special moment frame structures designed for San Francisco are subjected to suites of earthquake ground motion records to evaluate deformation response for a range of earthquake intensities. From these analyses the statistics of demand are estimated and used, along with models of capacity and seismic hazard, to evaluate the expected repair costs and loss of function over the life of each building. Performing this analysis for a range of values for each design variable will demonstrate the influence of stiffness, strength, and deformation capacity on building seismic performance, which can be used for evaluating and enhancing community resilience.},

Potential housing damage, habitability, human displacement and sheltering needs are key concerns for emergency managers following tsunami events. This article presents a novel approach to address these requirements. We first review available literature on factors influencing residential habitability, human displacement and sheltering needs following disasters. Existing models are reviewed to identify lessons, gaps and opportunities that can inform the development of a new model. We then present a new model for estimating habitability, displacement and sheltering needs for tsunami ({HDS}-T). The model uses an additive scoring system incorporating both physical and demographic factors, weighted according to their relative influence. We demonstrate application of {HDS}-T through the case study of three tsunami scenarios affecting the coastal city of Christchurch, New Zealand. The results are time-varying, reflecting the response and early recovery phase of the tsunami events. For the largest scenario, 14,695 residents are displaced on the first day, with 1795 displaced residents requiring sheltering assistance. The number of displaced residents reduces to 9014 on Day 4, 7131 on Day 7, and 4366 at the time point of one month. {HDS}-T is designed to be adaptable to other natural hazards and contexts, such as earthquakes.},

Fire is considered either as a single or cascading multi-hazard event, with a dedicated section on fire-following-earthquake. First, a description of the fire issue in developed countries is provided based on discussion of past incidents and data on fire-related human and economic costs. Then, the current approach to fire safety is critically examined. It is argued that this approach is unable to deliver the resiliency level expected from the buildings and infrastructure systems in our modern, interconnected societies. The case is made for a complementary, performance-based approach to fire safety, which builds on new paradigms in terms of Goal, Scale, Uncertainty, and Hazard Scenario. Recent advances made in other structural engineering subfields, most notably seismic engineering, are briefly reviewed to provide context to resilience assessment and performance-based designs, while highlighting the specificities of structural fire engineering. Then, the research toward advancing the principles of resilience in structural fire engineering is examined, including current gaps in knowledge. The case of fire-following-earthquake is explored. Finally, the chapter concludes with perspectives on the future of the topic.},

	abstract = {Earthquake-induced damage to the built infrastructure can generate enormous societal impact, ranging from displacement of individual families and businesses to disruption of entire economic sectors and public services. Consequently, engineers play a critical role in mitigating these cascading, multiscale earthquake impacts. A significant component in this effort involves designing buildings and other structures to avoid the types of damage that can lead to loss of functionality and downtime after an earthquake. Toward this end, this paper describes the state of the art in assessing earthquake-induced loss of functionality in individual buildings. More specifically, it details how earthquake-induced loss of functionality within the built infrastructure can generate multiscale impacts that cascade through a community across space and time. It also compiles from various sources a consistent hierarchy of definitions for building functionality, and examines the myriad combinations of events and failures that can impact it, culminating with the development of functionality-restoration curves that graphically depict how the availability of various building components and systems affect recovery. The paper then reviews, both recently developed analytical models for evaluating loss of functionality in individual buildings and also current practice for designing buildings to maintain or regain functionality after earthquakes. Lastly, the paper identifies several critical gaps in knowledge and areas of future research that need to be addressed in order for the engineering profession to, both design buildings to quickly regain functionality after a major earthquake and also more effectively communicate risk with community stakeholders (e.g., building owners, emergency managers, and city planners).},

	abstract = {Residential building codes intended to promote health and safety may produce unintended countervailing risks by adding to the cost of construction. Higher construction costs increase the price of new homes and may increase health and safety risks through “income” and “stock” effects. The income effect arises because households that purchase a new home have less income remaining for spending on other goods that contribute to health and safety. The stock effect arises because suppression of new-home construction leads to slower replacement of less safe housing units. These countervailing risks are not presently considered in code debates. We demonstrate the feasibility of estimating the approximate magnitude of countervailing risks by combining the income effect with three relatively well understood and significant home-health risks. We estimate that a code change that increases the nationwide cost of constructing and maintaining homes by \$150 (0.1\% of the average cost to build a single-family home) would induce offsetting risks yielding between 2 and 60 premature fatalities or, including morbidity effects, between 20 and 800 lost quality-adjusted life years (both discounted at 3\%) each year the code provision remains in effect. To provide a net health benefit, the code change would need to reduce risk by at least this amount. Future research should refine these estimates, incorporate quantitative uncertainty analysis, and apply a full risk-tradeoff approach to real-world case studies of proposed code changes.},

The {HGBS} data (released in 2015 based on year 2010 census data) underestimates all building square footage by between 15 and 20\% and overestimates replacement costs by between 31\% (without considering depreciation) and 56\% (including depreciation). The magnitude of {HGBS} inventory differences vary across structure types, particularly among different classes of commercial structures, but are markedly consistent across the three locations. Because the {HGBS} underestimates structure size and overestimates replacement costs, it severely overestimates replacement costs on a dollar per square foot basis, on average by between 51 and 81\%. These large overestimates could potentially occur with a partial or hybrid Level 2 {HAZUS} analysis, in which supplemental structural square footage is obtained from a non-{HGBS} source, such as a tax assessor, while using default {HGBS} building replacement cost data.},

	abstract = {The marked increase in the awareness of earthquake risk following the Canterbury earthquakes in New Zealand offered a unique opportunity to investigate the economic effect of disaster-mitigation regulations on the commercial building stock. A difference-in-differences ({DD}) framework was used to determine whether earthquake risk has been capitalized into the property prices of buildings constructed prior to 1976, as a response to the national policy requiring assessment and strengthening (or demolition) of the existing earthquake-prone building stock. A negative externality is found in the policy announcement on affected (pre-1970s) office and retail buildings which caused office buildings to suffer a 12.5\% stigma discount. However, retail properties were less impacted suffering a 2.3\% stigma loss. The value of the commercial building stock has been affected by the policy. These findings provide policy-makers with timely evidence as to the economic effects of New Zealand’s earthquake-prone buildings policy. Facing losses in property value and financial responsibility for retrofitting their assets, building owners will be looking for a workable set of regulatory and non-regulatory incentives to encourage disaster risk management and protect the built environment.},

	abstract = {The Italian territory is largely prone to seismic risk and 6 million buildings require seismic retrofitting. In the last three main seismic events (Abruzzo 2009, Emilia Romagna in 2012 and in Lazio in 2016) 633 people died and considerable financial losses such as the structural collapse of buildings and interruption of production activities were incurred. During the period 1944\&ndash;2017, economic losses caused by seismic events amounted to {EUR} 212 billion. More than 80\% of the entire building stock does not respect seismic design standards provided by Italian regulations ({NTC} 2018). Seismic retrofitting of buildings may avoid many deaths and financial losses, as well as increase people\&rsquo;s safety. In addition, seismic retrofitting of buildings may also generate an increase in real estate asset value (namely a market price premium), which may accelerate investments. Despite the relevance of this issue, there is a lack of literature, which investigates the key factors in boosting investments and the market price premium for retrofitted buildings in detail. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap with respect to the Italian Real Estate market. To estimate the capitalization effect of benefits produced by seismic retrofitting on property market values, it is fundamental to know how much people are willing to pay for it. As, to our knowledge, there are no available datasets which provide house characteristics, including seismic performances and market prices of Italian real estate assets, we implemented a contingent valuation approach to determine the market price premium for retrofitted assets. In detail, information about the willingness to pay ({WTP}) an additional price for a seismically retrofitted home (by considering different risk exposure), ceteris paribus was elicited using open-ended questions in a self-administered web interview. In particular, we applied the methodology to a case study, i.e., a contingent scenario related to masonry-detached houses located in a seismic hazard zone. Our results revealed that individuals are willing to pay an additional price for retrofitted assets and the average market price premium ranges from 10\% to 52\% of the property market price.},

It identifies the root causes and scrutinises the suitable mitigation actions of financial-related project delays. Four main factors were identified in the literature, namely late payment, poor cash flow management, insufficient financial resources and financial market instability. Primary data were collected by way of a preliminary interview, questionnaire survey and in-depth structured interviews. A total of 110 responses were obtained from a combination of clients, contractors, consultants and bankers. The result revealed that poor cash flow management is the most significant factor that leads to a project's delay followed by late payment, insufficient financial resources and financial market instability. Contractors' instable financial background, client's poor financial and business management, difficulties in obtaining loan from financiers and inflation were identified as the most significant underlying causes. The study findings indicate that clients play the most important role in reducing the impact of financial problems towards the extent of project's delay. Several suitable mitigation actions were suggested by the respondents. The study highlights the importance of having more intensive research that give emphasis on clients achieving a well-managed cash flow in order to obtain a prompt payment practice in the construction industry.},

This constant is derived by dividing value per statistical life ({VSL}) estimates by expected future {QALYs}. We explore the theoretical validity of this practice by studying the properties of {WTP} for improved health and longevity in a framework that makes minimal assumptions about the shape of an agent's utility function. We find that dividing {VSL} by expected {QALYs} results in an upper bound on the {WTP} for a marginal improvement in the quality of life, as measured by gains in health status or longevity. Calibration results suggest that analysts using this approach to monetize health benefits overestimate the value of a program or policy by a factor of two on average. We also derive a lower bound on the {WTP} for improved health and longevity that permits a novel empirical test for the descriptive validity of the {QALY} model. Our calibrations suggest that this lower bound is on average 20\% smaller than the actual {WTP}.},

However, the procedure of including and monetising the health benefits in cost–benefit analysis ({CBA}) has been somewhat scattered and inconsistent in the literature, and there is a need for a comparison of available methods. First, through a literature review, we identified the methods to include health benefits in decision support and to monetise these benefits in {CBA}. Second, we applied the identified health valuation methods in a case study. In the case study, we investigated if changing the health valuation method could change the rank order of the decision alternatives’ net present values. In the case study a risk-based decision model that combined quantitative microbial risk assessment and {CBA} was used. Seven health valuation methods were identified, each of them including different aspects of health benefits. The results of the case study showed that the choice of the health valuation method can change the rank order of decision alternatives with respect to their net present values. These results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate health valuation method for the specific application. Although this study focused on the drinking water context, the identified health valuation methods can be applied in any decision support context, provided that input in terms of the health risk reduction is available.},

Using a nationally-representative longitudinal survey including 28,347 individuals followed during 2002–2015 in Australia, we estimate that individual's willingness to pay for one {QALY} is approximately A\$42,000-A\$67,000, and the willingness to pay for not having a long-term condition approximately A\$2000 per year. As the estimates are derived using population-level data and a wellbeing measurement of life satisfaction, the approach has the advantage of being socially inclusive and recognizes the significant meaning of people's subjective valuations of health.

	abstract = {Quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs}) measure utility lost to nonfatal health problems. Economists using existing, empirically validated {QALY} scales in unmonetized or monetized form can help guide jury valuations of suffering and quality of life loss, increase award predictability, and thus encourage settlement. Valuing a plaintiff's utility loss starts with medical assessment of health status changes on a {QALY} scale. Key considerations in scale selection are the ability to accurately measure the plaintiff's functional losses (e.g., using a scale differentiating sensory losses for a blinded victim) and availability of a good calibration that converts functional loss to utility loss. {QALYs} are replicable and objective. In regulatory analyses, their most controversial aspect is the method for converting functional losses to {QALY} losses, which theory suggests should be probabilistic. In post-event application, probabilistic rating is not theoretically required. Thermometer ratings yield valid multi-attribute utility loss estimates. The paper explains how to monetize {QALYs}.},

This was achieved by utilizing two employers’ well-being assessments with medical and pharmacy administrative claims (2010–2011) across a large national employer (n = 50,647) and regional employer (n = 6170) data sets. This retrospective study sought to monetize both direct and indirect value of well-being improvement across a population whose medical costs are covered by an employer, insurer, and/or government entity. Logistic regression models were employed to estimate disease incidence rates and input–output modelling was used to measure indirect effects of well-being improvement. These methodological components removed the burden of specifying an exhaustive number of regression models, which would be difficult in small populations. Members who improved their well-being were less likely to become diseased. This reduction saved, per avoided occurrence, {US}\$3060 of total annual health care costs. Of the members who were diseased, improvement in well-being equated to annual savings of {US}\$62 while non-diseased members saved {US}\$26. The method established here demonstrates the linkage between improved well-being and improved outcomes while maintaining applicability in varying populations.},

Results are presented in terms of expected losses under the design basis earthquake, expected annual losses, and present value of life cycle losses. Expected annual economic losses for the set of {RC} frame buildings are approximately 1.0\% of building replacement cost for the high seismic California site considered. Repair costs are shown to vary significantly depending on building height and other architectural and structural design parameters.

	abstract = {Expected annual loss ({EAL}), which can be expressed in dollars, is an effective way of communicating the seismic vulnerability of constructed facilities to owners and insurers. A simplified method for estimating {EAL} without conducting time-consuming non-linear dynamic analyses is presented. Relationships between intensity measures and engineering demand parameters resulting from a pushover analysis and a modified capacity-spectrum method are combined with epistemic and aleatory uncertainties to arrive at a probabilistic demand model. Damage measures are established to determine thresholds for damage states from which loss ratios can be defined. Financial implications due to damage can then be quantified in the form of {EAL} by integrating total losses for all likely earthquake scenarios. This rapid loss estimation method is verified through the computationally intensive incremental dynamic analysis, with the results processed using a distribution-free methodology. To illustrate the application of the proposed method, the seismic vulnerability of two highway bridge piers is compared; one bridge is traditionally designed for ductility while the other is based on an emerging damage avoidance design ({DAD}) philosophy. The {DAD} pier is found to have a clear advantage over the conventional pier; the {EAL} of the {DAD} pier is less than 20\% of its ductile counterpart. This is shown to be primarily due to its inherent damage-free behaviour for small to medium earthquake intensities, whose contribution to {EAL} is significantly more than that of very rare events.

	abstract = {Various loss assessment methodologies have been proposed and developed over the past decades to provide risk assessment on a regional scale. There is an increasing need, however, to provide engineers with practical tools for building-specific loss assessment. Recently, progress has been made towards probabilistic loss models such as the {PEER} framework. However, as comprehensive probabilistic methodologies could be too complex for practicing engineers, this article presents a simplified probabilistic loss assessment methodology that builds on a direct displacement-based framework. The methodology is tested via examination of two {RC} frame buildings and encouragingly shows similar results to the {PEER} methodology.},

	abstract = {Performance assessment implies that the structural, non-structural, and content systems are given and that decision variables, {DVs}, (e.g. expected annual loss, mean annual frequency of collapse) are computed and compared to specified performance targets. Performance-based design ({PBD}) is different by virtue of the fact that the building and its components and systems first have to be created. Good designs are based on concepts that incorporate performance targets up front in the conceptual design process, so that subsequent performance assessment becomes more of a verification process of an efficient design rather than a design improvement process that may require radical changes of the initial design concept. In short, the design approach could consist of (a) specifying performance targets (e.g. tolerable probability of collapse, acceptable dollar losses) and associated seismic hazards, and (b) deriving engineering parameters for system selection, or perhaps better, using the relatively simple design decision support tools discussed in this paper.

	abstract = {Background
               Research on post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}) following natural and human-made disasters has been undertaken for more than three decades. Although {PTSD} prevalence estimates vary widely, most are in the 20–40\% range in disaster-focused studies but considerably lower (3–5\%) in the few general population epidemiological surveys that evaluated disaster-related {PTSD} as part of a broader clinical assessment. The World Mental Health ({WMH}) Surveys provide an opportunity to examine disaster-related {PTSD} in representative general population surveys across a much wider range of sites than in previous studies.
            
            
               Method
               Although disaster-related {PTSD} was evaluated in 18 {WMH} surveys, only six in high-income countries had enough respondents for a risk factor analysis. Predictors considered were socio-demographics, disaster characteristics, and pre-disaster vulnerability factors (childhood family adversities, prior traumatic experiences, and prior mental disorders).
            
            
               Results
               Disaster-related {PTSD} prevalence was 0.0–3.8\% among adult (ages 18+) {WMH} respondents and was significantly related to high education, serious injury or death of someone close, forced displacement from home, and pre-existing vulnerabilities (prior childhood family adversities, other traumas, and mental disorders). Of {PTSD} cases 44.5\% were among the 5\% of respondents classified by the model as having highest {PTSD} risk.
            
            
               Conclusion
               Disaster-related {PTSD} is uncommon in high-income {WMH} countries. Risk factors are consistent with prior research: severity of exposure, history of prior stress exposure, and pre-existing mental disorders. The high concentration of {PTSD} among respondents with high predicted risk in our model supports the focus of screening assessments that identify disaster survivors most in need of preventive interventions.},

	issn = {1054-8289},
	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/43755231},
	abstract = {We can expect climate change to alter the frequency, magnitude, timing, and location of many natural hazards. For example, heat waves are likely to become more frequent, and heavy downpours and flooding more common and more intense. Hurricanes will likely grow more dangerous, rising sea levels will mean more coastal flooding, and more-frequent and moreintense droughts will produce more wildfires. Children, particularly the poor and those in developing countries, are at risk. Carolyn Kousky considers three ways that natural disasters may harm children disproportionately, often with long-lasting effects. First, disasters can damage children s physical health. Children may be injured or killed, but they may also suffer from such things as malnutrition caused by disruptions in food supply or diarrheal illness caused by contaminated water. Moreover, disasters can cut off access to medical care, even for non-disaster-related illnesses. Second, disasters can cause mental health problems. Not only are disasters themselves stressful and frightening, but children can suffer psychological harm from the damage to their homes and possessions; from migration; from the grief of losing loved ones; from seeing parents or caregivers undergo stress; from neglect and abuse; and from breakdowns in social networks, neighborhoods, and local economies. Third, disasters can interrupt children's education by displacing families, destroying schools, and pushing children into the labor force to help their families make ends meet in straitened times. How can we mitigate the dangers to children even as disasters become more powerful and more frequent? For one thing, we can prepare for disasters before they strike, for example, by strengthening school buildings and houses. Kousky also describes actions that have been proven to help children after a disaster, such as quickly reuniting them with parents and caregivers. Finally, a range of policies not designed for disasters can nonetheless help mitigate the harm disasters cause children and their families. In fact, Kousky writes, using existing safety net programs may be easier, faster, and more effective than creating entirely new programs after a disaster occurs.},

	abstract = {Measuring quality-adjusted-life years using generic preference-based quality of life measures is common practice when evaluating health interventions. However, there are concerns that measures in common use, such as the {EQ}-5D and {SF}-6D, focus overly on physical health and therefore may not be appropriate for measuring quality of life for people with mental health problems. The aim of this research was to identify the domains of quality of life that are important to people with mental health problems in order to assess the content validity of these generic measures. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 people, recruited from {UK} mental health services, with a broad range of mental health problems at varying levels of severity. This complemented a previous systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies on the same topic. Seven domains important to quality of life for people with mental health problems were identified: well-being and ill-being; relationships and a sense of belonging; activity; self-perception; autonomy, hope and hopelessness; and physical health. These were consistent with the systematic review, with the addition of physical health as a domain, and revealed a differing emphasis on the positive and negative aspects of quality of life according to the severity of the mental health problems. We conclude that the content of existing generic preference-based measures of health do not cover this domain space well. Additionally, because people may experience substantial improvements in their quality of life without registering on the positive end of a quality of life scale, it is important that the full spectrum of negative through to positive aspects of each domain are included in any quality of life measure.},

	abstract = {Mental disorders are common worldwide, yet the quality of care for these disorders has not increased to the same extent as that for physical conditions. In this paper, we present a framework for promoting quality measurement as a tool for improving quality of mental health care. We identify key barriers to this effort, including lack of standardized information technology‐based data sources, limited scientific evidence for mental health quality measures, lack of provider training and support, and cultural barriers to integrating mental health care within general health environments. We describe several innovations that are underway worldwide which can mitigate these barriers. Based on these experiences, we offer several recommendations for improving quality of mental health care. Health care payers and providers will need a portfolio of validated measures of patient‐centered outcomes across a spectrum of conditions. Common data elements will have to be developed and embedded within existing electronic health records and other information technology tools. Mental health outcomes will need to be assessed more routinely, and measurement‐based care should become part of the overall culture of the mental health care system. Health care systems will need a valid way to stratify quality measures, in order to address potential gaps among subpopulations and identify groups in most need of quality improvement. Much more attention should be devoted to workforce training in and capacity for quality improvement. The field of mental health quality improvement is a team sport, requiring coordination across different providers, involvement of consumer advocates, and leveraging of resources and incentives from health care payers and systems.},

	shorttitle = {Willingness-to-Pay},
	abstract = {From a welfarist perspective, Willingness to Pay ({WTP}) is relevant only as a proxy for individual preferences or utilities. Much of the criticism levied against the {WTP} criterion can be understood as saying that {WTP} is a bad proxy for utility – that {WTP} contains limited information about preferences. Specifically, the claim is that wealth effects prevent {WTP} from serving as a good proxy for utility. I formalize this critique and extend it. I develop a methodology for quantifying the informational content of {WTP}. The informational content of {WTP} depends on how {WTP} is measured and applied. First, I distinguish between two types of policies: (i) policies that are not paid for by the individuals who are affected by the policy; and (ii) policies that are paid for by the individuals who are affected by the policy. Second, I distinguish between two types of {WTP} measures: (i) individualized {WTP}; and (ii) uniform, average {WTP} (like the {VSL}). When the cost of the policy is not borne by the affected individuals, individualized {WTP} has low informational content and increases wealth disparity. Uniform, average {WTP} has higher informational content and reduces wealth disparity, at least in the case of universal benefits. Therefore, when possible, a uniform, average {WTP} should be preferred in this scenario. When the cost of the policy is borne by the affected individuals, individualized {WTP} has high informational content but increases wealth disparity. Uniform, average {WTP} has lower informational content and indeterminate distributional implications. Here, the choice between individualized {WTP} and uniform, average {WTP} is more difficult.I briefly consider two extensions. The first involves time. I present a dynamic extension of the relationship between the informational content of {WTP} and the wealth distribution. The second extension emphasizes the effect of forward-looking rationality on the {WTP} measure. The question of rationality raises additional concerns about {WTP}-based policy-making.},

as a tool for estimating patient preferences within the economic evaluation of 
healthcare technologies. It has been suggested that where cost is included as 
one of the attributes within the exercise, {CA} can be used to estimate 
willingness to pay ({WTP}) for healthcare interventions indirectly within the

advantages of {CA} as a technique for the assessment of benefits in health care, 
this paper recommends several avenues of investigation that need to be 
carefully explored before an informed judgment can be made as to the validity 
of eliciting {WTP} values using the {CA} methodology. It is argued that much can 
be learned from the use of qualitative research techniques in examining 
individuals' understanding and interpretation of {CA} questions where cost 
is included as an attribute in the exercise. Additionally, further research is 
required in defining techniques for establishing the most appropriate levels 
for the cost attribute in a {CA} exercise and in determining the sensitivity of 
{WTP} estimates to the levels that are chosen for the cost attribute.},

	abstract = {Many people have wondered why the {US} government conducts cost-benefit analysis with close reference to the value of a statistical life ({VSL}). It is helpful to answer that question by reference to the “Easy Cases,” in which those who benefit from regulatory protection must pay for it. In such cases, {WTP} is usually the right foundation for {VSL}, because beneficiaries are hardly helped by being forced to pay for regulatory protection that they believe not to be in their interests. In the Easy Cases, arguments from both welfare and autonomy support the use of {WTP} and {VSL} (with potentially important qualifications involving imperfect information and behavioral market failures). The analysis is less straightforward in harder cases, in which beneficiaries do not pay for all of the cost of what they receive (and may pay little of that cost). In such cases, arguments from welfare and autonomy might not lead in any clear direction. In the harder cases, regulation might be justified on welfare grounds even if the cost-benefit analysis (based on {VSL}) suggests that it is not. In principle, a direct inquiry into welfare (the master concept) would be preferable to use of cost-benefit analysis. In the harder cases, distributional considerations might also count in favor of proceeding (as prioritarianism suggests). But at the current time, direct inquiries into welfare consequences and into distributional effects are challenging in practice, and hence regulators should generally rely on cost-benefit analysis, making welfarist adjustments, or adjustments based on distributional considerations, only in compelling cases.},

	abstract = {Background
The contingent valuation ({CV}) method is used to estimate the willingness to pay ({WTP}) for services and products to inform cost benefit analyses ({CBA}). A long-standing criticism that stated {WTP} estimates may be poor indicators of actual {WTP}, calls into question their validity and the use of such estimates for welfare evaluation, especially in the health sector. Available evidence on the validity of {CV} studies so far is inconclusive. We systematically reviewed the literature to (1) synthesize the evidence on the criterion validity of {WTP}/willingness to accept ({WTA}), (2) undertake a meta-analysis, pooling evidence on the extent of variation between stated and actual {WTP} values and, (3) explore the reasons for the variation.
Methods
Eight electronic databases were searched, along with citations and reference reviews. 50 papers detailing 159 comparisons were identified and reviewed using a standard proforma. Two reviewers each were involved in the paper selection, review and data extraction. Meta-analysis was conducted using random effects models for ratios of means and percentage differences separately. Meta-bias was investigated using funnel plots.
Results
Hypothetical {WTP} was on average 3.2 times greater than actual {WTP}, with a range of 0.7–11.8 and 5.7 (0.0–13.6) for ratios of means and percentage differences respectively. However, key methodological differences between surveys of hypothetical and actual values were found. In the meta-analysis, high levels of heterogeneity existed. The overall effect size for mean summaries was 1.79 (1.56–2.04) and 2.37 (1.93–2.80) for percent summaries. Regression analyses identified mixed results on the influence of the different experimental protocols on the variation between stated and actual {WTP} values. Results indicating publication bias did not account for differences in study design.
Conclusions
The evidence on the criterion validity for {CV} studies is more mixed than authors are representing because substantial differences in study design between hypothetical and actual {WTP}/{WTA} surveys are not accounted for.},

As it operates in the actual world of government practice, however, cost-benefit analysis usually does not need to explore the hardest questions, and when it does so, it tends to enlist standardized methods and tools (often captured in public documents that are binding within the executive branch). It is useful to approach cost-benefit analysis not in the abstract but from the bottom up, that is, by anchoring the discussion in specific scenarios involving tradeoffs and valuations. In order to provide an understanding of how cost-benefit analysis actually works, thirty-six stylized scenarios are presented here, alongside an exploration of how they might be handled in practice. A recurring theme is the importance of authoritative documents, which may be altered only after some kind of formal process, one that reflects a form of "government by discussion." Open issues, including the proper treatment of nonquantifiable values, are also discussed.},

The difference between {HWTP} and {RWTP} is the “hypothetical bias.” A prevalent assumption in marketing science is that indirect methods measure {WTP} more accurately than do direct methods. With a meta-analysis of 77 studies reported in 47 papers and resulting in 115 effect sizes, we test that assumption by assessing the hypothetical bias. The total sample consists of 24,347 included observations for {HWTP} and 20,656 for {RWTP}. Moving beyond extant meta-analyses in marketing, we introduce an effect size metric (i.e., response ratio) and a novel analysis method (i.e., multivariate mixed linear model) to analyze the stochastically dependent effect sizes. Our findings are relevant for academic researchers and managers. First, on average, the hypothetical bias is 21\%, and this study provides a reference point for the expected magnitude of the hypothetical bias. Second, the deviation primarily depends on the use of a direct or indirect method for measuring {HWTP}. In contrast with conventional wisdom, indirect methods actually overestimate {RWTP} significantly stronger than direct methods. Third, the hypothetical bias is greater for higher valued products, specialty goods (cf. other product types), and within-subject designs (cf. between-subject designs), thus a stronger downward adjustment of {HWTP} values is necessary to reflect consumers’ {RWTP}.},

The research presented in this paper adapts the inventory policy by including both the shrinkage fraction and the impact of {RFID} technology. Accordingly, by comparing the situation with {RFID} and the one without {RFID} in terms of costs, an exact analytical expression can be derived for the break-even prices of an {RFID} tag. It turns out that these break-even prices are highly related with the value of the items that are lost, the shrinkage fraction and the remaining shrinkage after implementing {RFID}.

	abstract = {Background: The introduction of Web-based education and open universities has seen an increase in access to professional development within the health professional education marketplace. Economic efficiencies of Web-based education and traditional face-to-face educational approaches have not been compared under randomized controlled trial conditions. Objective: To compare costs and effects of Web-based and face-to-face short courses in falls prevention education for health professionals. Methods: We designed two short courses to improve the clinical performance of health professionals in exercise prescription for falls prevention. One was developed for delivery in face-to-face mode and the other for online learning. Data were collected on learning outcomes including participation, satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and change in practice, and combined with costs, savings, and benefits, to enable a break-even analysis from the perspective of the provider, cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health service, and cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the participant. Results: Face-to-face and Web-based delivery modalities produced comparable outcomes for participation, satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and change in practice. Break-even analysis identified the Web-based educational approach to be robustly superior to face-to-face education, requiring a lower number of enrollments for the program to reach its break-even point. Cost-effectiveness analyses from the perspective of the health service and cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the participant favored face-to-face education, although the outcomes were contingent on the sensitivity analysis applied (eg, the fee structure used). Conclusions: The Web-based educational approach was clearly more efficient from the perspective of the education provider. In the presence of relatively equivocal results for comparisons from other stakeholder perspectives, it is likely that providers would prefer to deliver education via a Web-based medium.

The aim of this paper is to review these issues and estimate the importance of different assumptions for the cost per life-year gained. To analyse these assumptions a computer simulation model was constructed based on the Framingham logistic risk equations and Swedish cost data. It is shown that the cost per life-year gained is highly sensitive towards many of these assumptions. It is also shown that the average cost-effectiveness ratios calculated in previous studies and the relevant marginal cost-effectiveness ratios can differ by several hundred per cent. The results of cost-effectiveness analyses in the hypertension field have to be Interpreted with caution. Due to the lack of standardized methodology, the comparability between studies is limited. There is also a need to complement cost-effectiveness analysis in this area with other approaches, for example based on {WTP}.},

Inspired by recent resilience planning initiatives, we consider a situation where experts are asked to estimate the time for different infrastructure systems to recover to certain functionality levels after a scenario hazard event. We propose a methodological framework to use expert-elicited data to estimate the expected recovery time curve of a particular infrastructure system. This framework uses the Gaussian process regression ({GPR}) to capture the experts' estimation-uncertainty and satisfy known physical constraints of recovery processes. The framework is designed to find a balance between the data collection cost of expert elicitation and the prediction accuracy of {GPR}. We evaluate the framework on realistically simulated expert-elicited data concerning the two case study events, the 1995 Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake.},

Also, deterministic models have been increasingly replaced by those based on reliability and risk, which are probabilistic. Approaches to obtaining the optimum maintenance interval have typically involved minimization of the total associated cost. The present work demonstrates an improved technique involving the maximization of reliability-based benefit-to-cost ratio ({BCR}), i.e., the ratio of potential monetary benefit that can accrue from an optimized preventive maintenance ({PM}) schedule to the costs incurred in implementing such a schedule. It is shown that the methodology can be used to optimize the {PM} schedule for process units whose reliability function is either exponential or follows a Weibull distribution. A sensitivity analysis has also been performed to demonstrate the effect of various model parameters on the benefit-to-cost ratio. The proposed approach constitutes an improvement over the cost minimization methodology reported in contemporary literature, and can even be extended to plant shutdown planning.},

	abstract = {Limited studies have shown that disaster risk management ({DRM}) can be cost-efficient in a development context. Cost–benefit analysis ({CBA}) is an evaluation tool to analyse economic efficiency. This research introduces quantitative, stochastic {CBA} frameworks and applies them in case studies of flood and drought risk reduction in India and Pakistan, while also incorporating projected climate change impacts. {DRM} interventions are shown to be economically efficient, with integrated approaches more cost-effective and robust than singular interventions. The paper highlights that {CBA} can be a useful tool if certain issues are considered properly, including: complexities in estimating risk; data dependency of results; negative effects of interventions; and distributional aspects. The design and process of {CBA} must take into account specific objectives, available information, resources, and the perceptions and needs of stakeholders as transparently as possible. Intervention design and uncertainties should be qualified through dialogue, indicating that process is as important as numerical results.},

Data on impacts to the hospital system were collected using a standardized survey tool. A fault-tree analysis method is adopted to assess the functionality of critical hospital services based on three main contributing factors: staff, structure, and stuff. Damage to utility networks and to nonstructural components was found to have the most significant effect on hospital functionality. The functional curve is integrated over time to estimate the resilience of the regional acute-care hospital with and without the redistribution of its major services. The ability of the hospital network to offer redundancies in services after the earthquake increased the resilience of the Christchurch Hospital by 12\%. The resilience method can be used to assess future performance of hospitals, and to quantify the effectiveness of seismic retrofits, hospital safety legislation, and new seismic preparedness strategies.},

However, there is no systematic design guidelines for defining performance objectives, design fire scenarios, and methods of analysis. This paper focuses on steel framed buildings with composite floor slabs and provides an in-depth analysis of the structure under fire using performance-based fire engineering supported by computational modeling. First, a set of performance objectives and associated fire scenarios are defined. The scenarios include single- and multi-compartment fires as well as fire as a secondary event following a column loss. Then, response of the structure and effects of design changes are studied using different modeling approaches. Single slab, single slab with restraint, and full building models are investigated to understand the influence of continuity in the boundary conditions notably on the development of tensile membrane action. The full building model exhibited the most favorable behavior, while the single panel model without horizontal restraint was the most conservative. Best practices for computational modeling of a steel framed building under fire are discussed and recommendations are provided. The paper demonstrates an iterative design procedure, where systematic design changes are introduced to address the observed failure modes. It is shown that performance-based fire design can harness advanced computational models to examine the fire-structure behavior for multiple design alternatives and hazard scenarios.},

	abstract = {Recently, multihazards engineering has paid more attention to analyzing the behavior of a system exposed to different types of hazards and to estimate the loss data from cascading events attributed to the primary hazard. This paper investigates the principle of multihazards and develops a new methodology to assess the total damage of structural elements caused by cascading hazards. For each hazard, a physical model is used to assess the conditional probability of exceeding a certain intensity level due to the occurrence of the previous hazard. The method is applied to a hospital located in California subjected to three cascading hazards (earthquake, blast, and fire). Nonlinear time-history analyses are performed using seven ground motions scaled to five earthquake levels and the seismic response of the structure is evaluated. The seismic input produces damage to the hospital’s power supply (liquid propane gas reservoir tank), which may cause a blast. The probability of explosion is estimated by taking into account the probabilities of fuel leakage, fuel concentration, and ignition. A set of nine blast-intensity levels is considered in the analyses, corresponding to different quantities of fuel content inside the tank. Afterward, a fire hazard is generated following the explosion, the intensity level of which is evaluated using compartmental heat flux. The fire effects are modeled assuming an increment of temperature in the steel frames. The proposed multihazard approach can be used for both improving the structural safety and reducing the building lifecycle costs to enhance the resilience of the hospital. Results show that this methodology can be used to provide risk mitigation measures within a more general resilience framework.},

In finance, there is a broad spectrum of risk measures which reflect different asset performance goals and the risk appetite of the decision-maker. In this study, the authors leverage advancements in financial risk management to examine the role of risk measures to quantify the seismically induced financial risk, measure the benefit of seismic upgrading, and relate the benefit of seismic risk reduction to a degree of the implemented seismic upgrade. The findings demonstrate that the relation between the financial benefits of a seismic upgrade, quantified using risk measures that consider the full range of earthquake events, and the degree of the seismic upgrade are concave, that is, the incremental financial benefit reduces gradually with increasing degree of seismic upgrading. The opposite holds if the risk measures consider only the high-severity low-likelihood events. Therefore, the study shows that the selection of the risk measure plays a crucial role in determining the target degree of seismic upgrading. Equivalently, quantifying the financial benefits of seismic risk mitigation using different risk measures might lead to different seismic upgrading decisions for the same structure.},

	abstract = {Performance-based earthquake engineering procedures have now developed to the point that it is possible to evaluate a range of possible decision variables, including the expected annual monetary loss ({EAL}). Quantification of the {EAL} is considered to be particularly useful because it could assist with the identification of effective design and retrofit measures that consider seismic performance over a range of intensity levels. Recognizing, however, that existing procedures for the evaluation of {EAL} tends to be quite time consuming, this paper builds on a recent proposal to use simplified limit state loss versus intensity relationships to compute {EAL} via a closed-form equation, without the need to compile an inventory of damageable components and with freedom in the choice of structural analysis method. Various developments to the simplified approach are made in this paper to allow consideration of loss thresholds, non-uniform damage distributions and the impact of differences in seismic performance in orthogonal directions. In addition, means of accounting for uncertainties in the simplified {EAL} assessment are described. The work has focused on the assessment of {EAL} for reinforced concrete frame buildings with details representative of construction practice adopted in Italy in the 1950s through to the early 1970s. By comparing loss assessment results obtained using a refined methodology with those obtained using the new guidelines developed here for two case study buildings, it is concluded that the simplified approach works well. Future research should therefore aim to further validate the approach and extend it to other building typologies and construction eras. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Existing methods for the estimation of {EAL} are admirably rigorous but also represent a significant departure from current code assessment methods. By introducing simple loss vs. intensity relationships that are anchored to engineering limit states (set considering both structural and non-structural elements) it is shown that one can predict {EAL} values quickly, through a closed form expression that could be implemented easily in practice. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by comparing predictions of {EAL} with those obtained using refined {EAL} assessments, for a number of case study buildings. The limitations with the accuracy of the approach are discussed and the possibility of developing empirical loss vs. intensity relationships as part of future research is proposed.},

Given the policy move towards net zero energy homes, a more comprehensive set of inputs and robust assumptions are needed to support further regulatory change. Yet the literature provides substantial evidence of many private and societal costs and benefits not commonly incorporated into the economic assessments that underpin regulatory change.

Our preliminary considerations for social impact from wildfire are drawn from the synthesis of the literature on wildfire and other hazards. We explain how our considerations cover existing research insights and advance them by accounting for wildfire-specific impacts. Considerations are presented as a series of questions that could be answered by an assemblage of outside professionals and local key informants in an affected area for comparison and policy purposes. Those considerations could also be used to advance research questions related to wildfire exposure and impact.

The changes both in origin and destination community due to population displacement are described here on the basis of social ‘inclusion’ and ‘exclusion’ concept. The field survey was conducted during March–July 2010, and a sample of 280 respondents from 12 villages in southwest coastal Bangladesh was interviewed. Findings show that at the end of emergency aid, male members of the family started moving towards nearer cities to find an income. Based on the income and asset distribution at the community level, this study developed a societal cluster of displacement and demonstrates the societal changes because of cyclone-induced population displacement.},

	abstract = {Previous studies in the aftermath of natural disasters have demonstrated relationships between four dimensions of displacement – geographic distance from the predisaster community, type of postdisaster housing, number of postdisaster moves, and time spent in temporary housing – and adverse psychological outcomes. However, to date no study has explored how these dimensions operate in tandem. The literature is further limited by a reliance on postdisaster data. We addressed these limitations in a study of low-income parents, predominantly non-Hispanic Black single mothers, who survived Hurricane Katrina and who completed pre and postdisaster assessments (N = 392). Using latent profile analysis, we demonstrated three profiles of displacement experiences within the sample: (1) returned, characterized by return to a predisaster community; (2) relocated, characterized by relocation to a new community, and (3) unstably housed, characterized by long periods in temporary housing and multiple moves. Using regression analyses, we assessed the relationship between displacement profiles and three mental health outcomes (general psychological distress, posttraumatic stress, and perceived stress), controlling for predisaster characteristics and mental health indices and hurricane-related experiences. Relative to participants in the returned profile, those in the relocated profile had significantly higher general psychological distress and perceived stress, and those in the unstably housed profile had significantly higher perceived stress. Based on these results, we suggest interventions and policies that reduce postdisaster housing instability and prioritize mental health services in communities receiving evacuees.},

Certain outcomes (such as mortality, injury and cardiovascular disease risk factors) revealed inconsistent results, but these were rarely studied. Despite the frequency of post-disaster relocation and evidence of its effect on psychological morbidity, there is a relative paucity of studies; the few examples in the literature reveal weak study designs, inconsistent results, and inattention to physical health impacts and the challenges facing vulnerable populations.

Flooding is a central component of hurricane exposure, influencing mental health through multiple pathways that unfold over months after flooding recedes. Here we assess the concordance in self-reported and Federal Emergency Management ({FEMA}) flood exposure after Hurricane Sandy and determine the associations between flooding and anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). Self-reported flood data and mental health symptoms were obtained through validated questionnaires from New York City and Long Island residents (N = 1231) following Sandy. Self-reported flood data was compared to {FEMA} data obtained from the {FEMA} Modeling Task Force Hurricane Sandy Impact Analysis. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine the relationship between flooding exposure and mental health outcomes. There were significant discrepancies between self-reported and {FEMA} flood exposure data. Self-reported dichotomous flooding was positively associated with anxiety ({ORadj}: 1.5 [95\% {CI}: 1.1–1.9]), depression ({ORadj}: 1.7 [1.3–2.2]), and {PTSD} ({ORadj}: 2.5 [1.8–3.4]), while self-reported continuous flooding was associated with depression ({ORadj}: 1.1 [1.01–1.12]) and {PTSD} ({ORadj}: 1.2 [1.1–1.2]). Models with {FEMA} dichotomous flooding ({ORadj}: 2.1 [1.5–2.8]) or {FEMA} continuous flooding ({ORadj}: 1.1 [1.1–1.2]) were only significantly associated with {PTSD}. Associations between mental health and flooding vary according to type of flood exposure measure utilized. Future hurricane preparedness and recovery efforts must integrate micro and macro-level flood exposures in order to accurately determine flood exposure risk during storms and realize the long-term importance of flooding on these three mental health symptoms.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Social networks offer important emotional and instrumental support following natural disasters. However, displacement may geographically disperse network members, making it difficult to provide and receive support necessary for psychological recovery after trauma.
Objectives
We examine the association between distance to network members and post-traumatic stress using survey data, and identify potential mechanisms underlying this association using in-depth qualitative interviews.
Methods
We use longitudinal, mixed-methods data from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina ({RISK}) Project to capture the long-term effects of Hurricane Katrina on low-income mothers from New Orleans. Baseline surveys occurred approximately one year before the storm and follow-up surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted five years later. We use a sequential explanatory analytic design. With logistic regression, we estimate the association of geographic network dispersion with the likelihood of post-traumatic stress. With linear regressions, we estimate the association of network dispersion with the three post-traumatic stress sub-scales. Using maximal variation sampling, we use qualitative interview data to elaborate identified statistical associations.
Results
We find network dispersion is positively associated with the likelihood of post-traumatic stress, controlling for individual-level socio-demographic characteristics, exposure to hurricane-related trauma, perceived social support, and New Orleans residency. We identify two social-psychological mechanisms present in qualitative data: respondents with distant network members report a lack of deep belonging and a lack of mattering as they are unable to fulfill obligations to important distant ties.
Conclusion
Results indicate the importance of physical proximity to emotionally-intimate network ties for long-term psychological recovery.},

	abstract = {Disasters are a large cause of internal displacement at the global level, in 2017 alone affecting more than 19 million people. This dimension of disaster risk is usually overlooked in many disaster risk management strategies and assessments. It is only very recently that efforts to quantify displacement risk and integrate that dimension into existing physical risk models have been made. A key component of internal displacement assessment is the quantification of its economic impacts, both direct and indirect, not only to make a figure available but to raise awareness and increase accountability among governments, stakeholders, policymakers, and decision makers. This article presents a novel and peril-agnostic methodology with which to estimate, using a scenario-based approach, the economic production lost because of internal population displacement. The methodology is applied by using as a triggering event the April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal M7.8 earthquake. The method quantifies the indirect cost caused by internal population displacement because of that event in terms of lost economic production and estimates the loss to be between {USD} 400 and 850 million.},

Variables in Part 1 include the actual responses to all of the items on the questionnaire. Additional variables are also provided that indicate which of several possible scenarios were read to the respondent in certain sections of the survey. In Section A, Preliminary Background Information, respondents were asked about their views on issues such as the number of police on the street, availability of programs designed to get people off drugs, civil rights of minority groups in the United States, and legal rights of people accused of serious crimes. In Section B, Test Screener, respondents were presented with two randomly-selected scenarios describing an individual convicted of certain crimes and were asked what the man's sentence should be in both scenarios. In Part 1, Imprisonment Decisions, respondents were presented with three sets of two scenarios out of a stock of eight possible scenarios. Each scenario described an individual who was convicted of certain crimes and received a specified prison sentence. Respondents were asked to compare the individuals described in each pair of scenarios and decide which of the two should be released from prison based on certain budget and prison capacity constraints. In Part 2, Criminal Response Decisions, respondents were presented with two more scenarios out of the main stock of eight and were asked what they considered appropriate punishments to be for the individuals in the scenarios, including type of sentence, length of sentence, whether a fine should be paid, how large the fine should be, whether the sentence should be reduced if a fine were paid and by how much, and who should receive the fine. In Part 3, Crime Prevention Decisions, respondents were asked to put themselves in the shoes of their local mayor and asked to suppose that the federal government had just given their city either 100 or 1,000 dollars per household. Respondents were given the option of giving it to local residents or spending it on more prisons, more drug and alcohol treatment programs for offenders convicted of nonviolent crimes, more police on the street, or more prevention programs to help keep youth out of trouble. Respondents were allowed to divide the money in any way they wanted among these five options. In Part 4, How Much Would You Be Willing to Pay?, respondents were asked a series of questions on whether they would be willing to pay certain randomly selected amounts of money out of their own pockets to reduce certain crimes. Respondents were then asked a series of questions on their own history of victimization and experiences with the criminal justice system. Respondents also supplied demographic information. Parts 2-7 of the dataset contain variables that were derived from the variables in Part 1. The primary difference between the data in Parts 2-7 and Part 1 is that Parts 2-7 do not contain a variable for every question that was asked. Instead, Parts 2-7 contain one variable for every possible scenario, which means that for every question in the survey instrument there could be several corresponding variables in Parts 2-7. Part 8 contains verbatim responses to open-ended survey items.},

As supply chains expand globally and companies pursue velocity and efficiency, the probability of disruptions propagating throughout a chain grows. In this paper, we employ a qualitative, grounded theory case study approach to help understand what drives supply chain disruption propagation and to provide theoretical insights into this emerging area. For a more complete perspective, we study three interconnected tiers in seven unique supply chains. Each supply chain triad consists of (1) a focal firm (a manufacturer), (2) a supplier to the focal firm and (3) a customer of the focal firm allowing us to gain perspective from three levels in multiple supply chains. Three aggregate dimensions are defined which help explain the propagation of supply chain disruptions: the nature of the disruption, structure and dependence, and managerial decision-making. Within these dimensions, six themes are identified giving an increased level of granularity into disruption propagation: correlation of risk, compounding effects, cyclical linkages, counterparty risk, herding and misaligned incentives. Organisations should consider these themes and their interactions to effectively deal with supply chain disruptions.},

Based on a review process important studies have been identified and analyzed. The content analysis of these studies synthesized existing information about the types of disruptions, their impact on supply chains, resilience methods in supply chain design and recovery strategies proposed by the studies supported by cost–benefit analysis. Our review also examines the most popular modeling approaches on the topic with indicative examples and the {IT} tools that enhance resilience and reduce disruption risks. Finally, a detailed future research agenda is formed about {SC} disruptions, which identifies the research gaps yet to be addressed. The aim of this study is to amalgamate knowledge on supply chain disruptions which constitutes an important and timely as the frequency and impact of disruptions increase. The study summarizes and builds upon the knowledge of other well-cited reviews and surveys in this research area.},

	abstract = {Many people have wondered why the {US} government conducts cost-benefit analysis with close reference to the value of a statistical life ({VSL}). It is helpful to answer that question by reference to the “Easy Cases,” in which those who benefit from regulatory protection must pay for it. In such cases, {WTP} is usually the right foundation for {VSL}, because beneficiaries are hardly helped by being forced to pay for regulatory protection that they believe not to be in their interests. In the Easy Cases, arguments from both welfare and autonomy support the use of {WTP} and {VSL} (with potentially important qualifications involving imperfect information and behavioral market failures). The analysis is less straightforward in harder cases, in which beneficiaries do not pay for all of the cost of what they receive (and may pay little of that cost). In such cases, arguments from welfare and autonomy might not lead in any clear direction. In the harder cases, regulation might be justified on welfare grounds even if the cost-benefit analysis (based on {VSL}) suggests that it is not. In principle, a direct inquiry into welfare (the master concept) would be preferable to use of cost-benefit analysis. In the harder cases, distributional considerations might also count in favor of proceeding (as prioritarianism suggests). But at the current time, direct inquiries into welfare consequences and into distributional effects are challenging in practice, and hence regulators should generally rely on cost-benefit analysis, making welfarist adjustments, or adjustments based on distributional considerations, only in compelling cases.},

Absent from this literature is an exploration of the role of individual decision-makers in determining the resilience strategies of firms, even though the hardiness of business is crucial to maintaining robust local, regional, and global economies. To address this, our research uses a randomized controlled experimental design to examine whether biological sex or gender diversity might lead to decision-making that improves investments in resilience to calamitous events. We study decisions related to a core resilience strategy, investment in inventories, across professional manager and student subject pools. We find that although females perceive a higher probability of a catastrophic event, male and female subjects do not make different investment decisions when faced with uncertainty and risk. Importantly, a gender construct capturing congruence with feminine personality attributes does correspond with increased resilience investment and is driven by differences between managers and students. Increased gender diversity in decision-making bodies may serve to improve economic resilience of firms and other organizations.},

Respondents intercepted at four cultural monuments provided information on their visitation patterns, experience at the site, perception of the state of conservation of the monuments, and rating of the quality of the services and infrastructure. We combine actual trips with stated trips under hypothetical programs that would enhance the conservation of the monuments and improve one of (i) the cultural experience at the site, (ii) the quality of the infrastructure, or (iii) the quality of the services, and use the combined actual and stated trips to fit a panel data model. Our study is one of the few applications of the {TCM} to value cultural heritage sites. Our investigation shows that (i) significant use values are associated with the four study monuments, and (ii) conservation programs and initiatives that improve the cultural experience, or simply make it easier for the respondent to reach and spend time at the monument, are valued by domestic visitors and would encourage higher visitation rates. Actual and intended trips reported by the respondents exhibit good construct validity, in the sense that they are well predicted by price, location, hypothetical scenario and other individual characteristics of the respondents.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of natural and human-made hazards on payroll, {GDP}, employment, and establishment survival/creation in the year of hazard occurrence in the U.S. economy and more specifically in the U.S. manufacturing/goods producing industry. Many of the papers that examine economic impacts of hazards consider upstream impacts of supply chain disruption. Measures of downstream impacts are often limited, particularly in measuring the short-term impacts. This paper examines how manufacturers and other establishments are impacted, at the industry and total economy level, by a disruption in supplies of goods with low substitutability, which is often referred to as the ripple effect. In this paper, eight models are developed to explore supply chain vulnerability, at the industry-level, to hazard events across geographic areas of the U.S. during the 2005 to 2016 time period. The most severe impacts are due to hazards in the manufacturing/goods industry supply chain, where payroll, {GDP}, and employment declined 2.9\%, 3.9\%, and 8.6\%, respectively. For all establishments, payroll and employment declined 5.3\% and 3.0\%, respectively. The results further suggest that the compound effect of hazards through the supply chain possibly exceeds that of the local hazard (i.e., direct impact). This can create an incentive misalignment. The establishment that invests in mitigation efforts and experiences the hazard locally does not directly experience the majority of the net benefit. The findings also suggest there is a need to better understand the short-term downstream impacts from all hazards, especially at the aggregated national level.},

Of critical importance to organizations such as the Department of Homeland Security ({DHS}) and state and county offices of emergency management, we find that firms are willing to pay for external resilience information when they operate in information-poor environments. We also find that when firms purchase resilience information, they are less susceptible to the decision-making bias known as the gambler’s fallacy, which has been shown to adversely affect firms operating in repeated disaster environments. This paper is one of the first of its kind to conduct experimental analysis on a national subject population of {CEOs} and {COOs} in the context of resilience. The results inform resilience planning efforts for public- and private-sector firms and organizations, with broad implications for the use of informational policy instruments to build economic resilience.},

There is ample research that outlines this relationship between thermal comfort and occupant productivity. However, there is a lack of literature that presents mathematical relationship between them. This paper presents a research experimental study that investigates effects of indoor environmental quality factors on thermal comfort and occupant productivity. This study was conducted by collecting indoor environmental quality parameters using sensors and online survey for twelve months. Data analysis was done using Response Surface Analysis to outline any mathematical relationship between indoor environmental quality and occupant productivity. The outlined relationships confirmed dependencies of occupant thermal comfort and productivity on various indoor environmental factors. These dependencies include the effect of {CO}2 concentration, {VOC} concentration. These relationships were analysed to rank nine indoor environmental parameters as per the degree of effect on occupant thermal comfort and productivity. These findings would help design professionals to design better office design that would improve occupants’ comfort and their productivity. Study results have different implications for professionals working in design, construction and operation of office buildings. It is recommended that design guidelines for office buildings should consider occupant productivity and incorporate recommended range for indoor environmental quality parameters in respective categories and criteria.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change pose many threats to our current way of life. However, the current mitigation agenda has not yet produced the carbon emission reductions needed implying that some level of adaptation will be required. For buildings this is likely to mean either drastic changes to architecture, occupant behaviour or the increased use of artificial cooling to maintain thermal comfort in the future. The capital cost of sustainable buildings is often perceived to be higher than for conventional buildings and there is little incentive to employ sustainable building adaptations over air-conditioning type solutions, making future reductions in carbon emissions unlikely. In this paper we investigate contributing factors to worker productivity in an attempt to justify the perceived cost of sustainable adaptations. Then as a proof of concept we estimate the potential savings that could be achieved by applying two simple adaptations to an office building to produce a more comfortable environment. It is hoped that this consideration of loss of productivity and its causes will aid not only in the choice of useful adaptation decisions, but also a consideration of payback periods will help persuade building commissioners of their value and overcome the perceptions about sustainable buildings.},

We use data on flood risk reduction activities and flood insurance purchases by surveying more than 1000 homeowners in New York City after they experienced Hurricane Sandy. Insurance is a complement to loss reduction measures undertaken well before the threat of suffering a loss, which is the opposite of a moral hazard effect of insurance coverage. In contrast, insurance acts as a substitute for emergency preparedness measures that can be taken when a loss is imminent, which implies that financial incentives or regulations are needed to encourage insured people to take these measures. We find that mechanisms leading to preferred risk selection are related to past flood damage and a crowding out effect of federal disaster assistance as well as behavioral motivations to reduce risk.},

Cost Benefit Analysis ({CBA}) is the traditional welfare approach to demonstrate the value of using public funds. {CBA} captures the tangible costs and benefits for users, the benefits and costs of externalities and some of the wider economic benefits. However, this welfare approach does not distinguish the distribution of activity impacts in terms of spatial locations, timing, or economic sectors, nor does it capture all impacts on the economy of a region. Economic Impact Analysis ({EIA}) shows such changes in terms of jobs, compensation and business output. Economic impact changes are very much the language used by politicians in explaining the benefits of an investment and making the points better understood by the electorate. This paper provides the rationale for using an extended analysis {EIA} as a complement to the welfare based {CBA}. The approach is illustrated by a case study of a bus rapid transit ({BRT}) proposal in Sydney. It shows how these approaches are complementary, answers different questions, and can be used together to provide a more holistic evaluation of the value of a public transport infrastructure change.},

The costs of construction, maintenance, and failure consequences, including deaths and injuries, as well as discounting cost over time, are considered. Optimal values are obtained of design variables and target reliability under single and multiple time-varying loads. Also investigated is sensitivity of the optimal design to important loading and structural parameters. The optimal design is found to depend primarily on the limit state consequences (costs), and to a lesser degree on the structural life. For multiple hazards, the optimal design is controlled by the hazard with large uncertainty and severe failure consequences.

	abstract = {A multi-objective optimization procedure is presented for designing steel moment resisting frame buildings within a performance-based seismic design framework. Life cycle costs are considered by treating the initial material costs and lifetime seismic damage costs as two separate objectives. Practical design/construction complexity, important but difficult to be included in initial cost analysis, is taken into due account by a proposed diversity index as another objective. Structural members are selected from a database of commercially available wide flange steel sections. Current seismic design criteria ({AISC}-{LRFD} seismic provisions and 1997 {NEHRP} provisions) are used to check the validity of any design alternative. Seismic performance, in terms of the maximum inter-storey drift ratio, of a code-verified design is evaluated using an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom system obtained through a static pushover analysis of the original multi-degree-of-freedom frame building. A simple genetic algorithm code is used to find a Pareto optimal design set. A numerical example of designing a five-storey perimeter steel frame building is provided using the proposed procedure. It is found that a wide range of valid design alternatives exists, from which a decision maker selects the one that balances different objectives in the most preferred way.

	abstract = {Energy efficiency in new building construction has become a key target to lower nation-wide energy use. The goals of this paper are to estimate life-cycle energy savings, carbon emission reduction, and cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency measures in new commercial buildings using an integrated design approach, and estimate the implications from a cost on energy-based carbon emissions. A total of 576 energy simulations are run for 12 prototypical buildings in 16 cities, with 3 building designs for each building-location combination. Simulated energy consumption and building cost databases are used to determine the life-cycle cost-effectiveness and carbon emissions of each design. The results show conventional energy efficiency technologies can be used to decrease energy use in new commercial buildings by 20–30\% on average and up to over 40\% for some building types and locations. These reductions can often be done at negative life-cycle costs because the improved efficiencies allow the installation of smaller, cheaper {HVAC} equipment. These improvements not only save money and energy, but reduce a building’s carbon footprint by 16\% on average. A cost on carbon emissions from energy use increases the return on energy efficiency investments because energy is more expensive, making some cost-ineffective projects economically feasible.},

	abstract = {Input-output analysis is frequently used in studies of large-scale weather-related (e.g., Hurricanes and flooding) disruption of a regional economy. The economy after a sudden catastrophe shows a multitude of imbalances with respect to demand and production and may take months or years to recover. However, there is no consensus about how the economy recovers. This article presents a theoretical route map for imbalanced economic recovery called dynamic inequalities. Subsequently, it is applied to a hypothetical postdisaster economic scenario of flooding in London around the year 2020 to assess the influence of future shocks to a regional economy and suggest adaptation measures. Economic projections are produced by a macro econometric model and used as baseline conditions. The results suggest that London's economy would recover over approximately 70 months by applying a proportional rationing scheme under the assumption of initial 50\% labor loss (with full recovery in six months), 40\% initial loss to service sectors, and 10–30\% initial loss to other sectors. The results also suggest that imbalance will be the norm during the postdisaster period of economic recovery even though balance may occur temporarily. Model sensitivity analysis suggests that a proportional rationing scheme may be an effective strategy to apply during postdisaster economic reconstruction, and that policies in transportation recovery and in health care are essential for effective postdisaster economic recovery.},

It is a supply-use model which considers production technologies and allows for supply side constraints. The model has been illustrated for three floods in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Results show that most of the neighboring regions gain from the flood due to increased demand for reconstruction and production capacity constraints in the affected region. Regions located further away or neighboring regions without a direct export link to the affected region mostly suffered small losses. These losses are due to the costs of increased inefficiencies in the production process that have to be paid for by all (indirectly) consuming regions. In the end, the floods cause regionally differentiated welfare effects.},

Priorities for protective measures and continuity of operations planning must consider the economic impact of such disruptions across a variety of scenarios.

	abstract = {This article proposes a new modeling framework to investigate the consequences of natural disasters and the following reconstruction phase. Based on input-output tables, its originalities are (1) the taking into account of sector production capacities and of both forward and backward propagations within the economic system; and (2) the introduction of adaptive behaviors. The model is used to simulate the response of the economy of Louisiana to the landfall of Katrina. The model is found consistent with available data, and provides two important insights. First, economic processes exacerbate direct losses, and total costs are estimated at \$149 billion, for direct losses equal to \$107 billion. When exploring the impacts of other possible disasters, it is found that total losses due to a disaster affecting Louisiana increase nonlinearly with respect to direct losses when the latter exceed \$50 billion. When direct losses exceed \$200 billion, for instance, total losses are twice as large as direct losses. For risk management, therefore, direct losses are insufficient measures of disaster consequences. Second, positive and negative backward propagation mechanisms are essential for the assessment of disaster consequences, and the taking into account of production capacities is necessary to avoid overestimating the positive effects of reconstruction. A systematic sensitivity analysis shows that, among all parameters, the overproduction capacity in the construction sector and the adaptation characteristic time are the most important.},

In addition, the impacts from the damages will spread over time, and will bring serious economic effects to other regions in a long run. Furthermore, the impacts of disasters are very complex, including not only the negative effects from damages and losses, but also the positive economic effects from the recovery and reconstruction activities. Most economic models and techniques cannot confront these significant changes in a relatively short time period, since they assume incremental, and/or predictable changes in systems over time. And, the unexpected nature of these events, especially in the case of earthquakes, creates a further complication of measuring the indirect impacts (Okuyama et al., 2002). At the same time, most available data for the direct damages and losses and of the recovery processes are engineering oriented, i. e., physical damages and disruption of lifelines and their repair and restoration, and the dimension and unit of these data are quite different from the economic counterpart—very detailed and short time span in engineering data while aggregated and longer time span in economic models. Consequently, these differences pose great challenges in order to model economic impacts of disasters.},

We apply an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly one million firms in Japan to estimate the direct and indirect effects of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake. We then employ the same model to predict the effect of the Nankai Trough earthquake, a mega earthquake predicted to hit major industrial cities in Japan in the near future. We find that the indirect effects of the disasters on production due to propagation (10.6\% of gross domestic product in the case of the Nankai earthquake) are substantially larger than their direct effects (0.5\%). Our simulation analyses to compare the actual network with hypothetical networks suggest that these indirect effects are more prominent and persistent when supply chains are characterized by scale-free properties, difficulty in substitution among intermediate products, and complex cycles in networks.},

This approach allows us to take full advantage of large secondary data bases of firm and disaster data in order to analyze the impact of over 3,500 disasters on more than 100,000 firm-year observations over 15 years. Our results indicate that disasters impact all sectors within a supply chain. We found that damage by windstorms and floods seem to be dramatically different from that of an earthquake, providing evidence against the all-hazards approach. We also show that the impact of floods on total asset turnover of a firm is dependent on the firm's position in the supply chain. We found that while upstream partners enjoy a positive impact, downstream partners have to plan for the opposite. Supply chain managers can use our results to better understand disaster impact on their business. Our study suggests a supply chain–wide mitigation strategy rather than a company-specific one.},

Using the methodology developed by Abadie et al. (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2010), we construct counterfactual dynamics for the Kobe economy. We identify a decline in per capita {GDP} that is attributable to the quake and is persistent, long-term, and clearly observable even 13 years after the quake. {GDP} per capita for 2008 was ¥400,000 per person lower (12\% decrease) than it would have been had the earthquake not occurred.

	abstract = {We explore the impact of natural disasters on the degree of agricultural protection using data from 76 countries thereby covering more than 70 of the most traded agricultural commodities. Theoretically, the direction of this effect is not a priori directly clear as it balances the trade-off between protecting the economic interests of the domestic agricultural sector on the one hand and ensuring food availability for the society at large on the other. Our most important findings suggest that natural disasters generally raise agricultural trade controls to favor domestic farmers. These barriers are mainly provided by limiting imports in the aftermath of a natural event. However, the protection pattern differs among countries. To be more specific, floods and storms increase agricultural protection in high-income countries, while trade barriers in many {LDCs} are reduced during periods of extreme drought in an attempt to diminish food scarcity. Finally, it turns out that a large part of the change in agricultural protection caused by a natural disaster is explained by a number of commodity specific particularities (i.e., food vs. cash crops).},

	abstract = {Recent empirical literature has found a negative relationship between income per capita and measures of risk from natural disaster, supportive of logic that higher incomes allow countries to mitigate disaster risk. We argue that behavioral changes at the micro level in response to increasing income (such as location choice and extent of costly abatement activity) may lead to a non-linear relationship between aggregate incomes and disaster damages, where the risks increase with income before they decrease. In a country-year panel data set, we show that disaster risk associated with flooding, landslides and windstorms increases with income up to {GDP} per capita levels of \$5044, \$3360, and \$4688 per year respectively and decrease thereafter. Such non-linear impacts are absent for other disaster types such as extreme temperature events and earthquakes where the links between human behavioral choices and exposure to risk are not as strong. From a policy perspective, this suggests that for the least developed countries, the dual goals of disaster risk prevention and economic development cannot be assumed to be complementary for all forms of natural disaster. In addition to allocating resources to manage disaster risk, the poorest nations may have to be more proactive in enacting policies that alter the behavioral choices of citizens that impact a country's exposure to natural disaster risk.},

In the long-term, our findings indicate a positive effect in one case and a negative effect in the other, largely reflecting divergent patterns of the {TFP}. Consistent with these findings, we offer further evidence suggesting that a quake and related financial aid might either increase technical efficiency via a disruptive creation mechanism or reduce it by stimulating corruption, distorting the markets and deteriorating social capital. Finally, we show that the bad outcome is more likely to occur in regions with lower pre-quake institutional quality. As a result, our evidence suggests that unanticipated local shocks are likely to change long run growth rates, exacerbating territorial disparities.},

Difference-in-difference results show that infants born closest to the epicenter were 0.2 percentage points more likely to be born with low birth weight.

Among the subsample of mothers most susceptible to stress – first-time, single mothers – low birth weight was 0.5 percentage points more likely to occur.

Affected individuals experience short-term economic losses but recover in the medium run (after 2–5 years), and even exhibit income and welfare gains in the long term (6–12 years). The stocks of productive assets, notably in farms, get reconstituted and public infrastructures are improved, seemingly partly through external aid, allowing productivity to recover. These findings tend to discount the presence of poverty traps and exhibit the potential long-term benefits from well-designed post-disaster interventions in contexts where disasters primarily affect physical assets.},

However, where there is disruption there is also opportunity. Businesses and other organisations will drive the physical, economic and social recovery of Canterbury, which will be a dynamic and long-term undertaking. Ongoing monitoring of the impacts, challenges and developments during the recovery is critical to maintaining momentum and making effective mid-course adjustments.

It was centred 11km beneath the rural town of Darfield, on the Greendale fault, which was previously unidentified. Christchurch City lies 40km east of Darfield, and was home to a population of approximately 370,000 at the time of the earthquake. There was extensive damage as a result of the {MM}9 shaking, particularly to buildings and infrastructure, but fortunately there were no deaths. The residents began the recovery process, plagued by frequent aftershocks. Then, more than five months after the mainshock, on 22 February 2011, a M6.3 aftershock occurred 5km south-east of Christchurch at a depth of only 5km. This earthquake struck at lunchtime on a working day, causing catastrophic damage to the city, and resulting in 185 deaths. Most of these casualties occurred as a result of the collapse of two large office buildings, with further deaths resulting from falling bricks and masonry, and rockfalls in city suburbs. The M7.1 earthquake and associated aftershocks have caused extensive impacts on the local built, economic, social, and natural environments. The on-going aftershocks have also caused a disrupted environment in which to recover. This paper will outline the nature of the Canterbury earthquakes and provide an introduction to the ongoing effects the earthquakes have had on these local environments to help frame the growing body of research coming out of the Canterbury earthquakes.},

A Difference-in-Difference ({DID}) model is used to model the events utilizing control and treatment variables to estimate price determinants. The findings indicate that after the 22 February 2011 Canterbury earthquake consumers’ are paying premiums of 15.1, 18.8 and 16.1\% to live on no risk, low risk and medium risk land, respectively, compared to high risk zoned land. This supports the hypothesis that consumers’ perception of risk became more acute after experiencing an extreme event. Risk premiums associated with safer land zones are not evident in the coefficients for control variables implying there was no accounting for land risk before the earthquakes.},

Additionally, I show that (a) the higher an earthquake’s death toll, the larger the increase in the price differential; (b) an earthquake in Europe has a significantly larger impact on California’s price differential than a similarly deadly earthquake in another region; and (c) the effects are transient and dissipate one month after the earthquake occurs.

Analyses of experimental data collected from 75 university students revealed that map comprehension scores were not significantly better for those who viewed a “best practices” map compared to those who viewed an existing version. This may be because the existing map was itself better than most other interactive maps. Additionally, we found map comprehension levels to have significant positive relationships with objective tests, but not self-reported measures of spatial ability. Moreover, self-reported spatial ability had statistically significant, but only moderately strong, correlations with objective tests. These results indicate that spatial ability should be measured objectively rather than through self-reported methods in research on map comprehension. Further research is needed to examine the cognitive processes involved in hazard map comprehension, especially using a broader range of map characteristics and population segments with more diverse cognitive abilities.},

The 2010/11 Christchurch (Canterbury region) earthquakes provided a new source of risk information to New Zealand home-buyers. We compare pre- and post-earthquake property prices in two other urban areas (one high, one low seismicity) to estimate how pricing of earthquake-related risks changed. We test for risk premia changes associated with soil liquefaction potential (previously largely ignored) and house construction type (with well-known safety implications), exploiting the two risk types across two areas with differing seismicity, pre- and post-earthquake. Consistent with rational responses, we find no evidence that the price of known construction risk changed in either area or that pricing of liquefaction risk changed in the low seismic area, while we find strong evidence that a liquefaction risk discount emerged in the high seismic area following the earthquakes. However the liquefaction risk discount in the high seismic area appears to have largely dissipated within four years.

Using geographically consistent data from 1970 to 2010 at the census tract level, I find that on average property values decline by 6.6 percent after the delineation of the fault zone, while rents decline by around 3.3 percent. I also examine the risk gradient and heterogeneity in willingness to pay using individual sales transactions, assessors' records, and publicly available mortgage data for the City of Los Angeles. The analysis of micro transactions data from 1997 to 2016 reveals that, on average, house prices increase by 1.8 percent for a one-mile increase in distance from the fault zone. The evidence also indicates that holding income and gender constant, Blacks and Hispanics are less willing than Whites to trade other forms of consumption to avoid earthquake risk.},

Results from boundary discontinuity design show the immediate sharp price reduction in {TC}3, relative to {TC}2, reached 17.7\% by the third year after the provision of {TC} classification, followed by a partial recovery that stabilized around 13\%.

We measure this regressivity as it manifested in the half a million insurance claims that resulted from the Canterbury earthquakes of 2011. As in other cases, this can be remedied with modifications to the program’s structure.},

Specifically, we test whether official declaration of a Wellington building as earthquake-prone (with a requirement for remediation to minimum earthquake code standards) had an effect on sale price relative to similarly earthquake-prone (but yet-to-be-declared) buildings. We find that the price discount accompanying an earthquake-prone declaration in the {CBD} averages 45\% whereas there is no observable discount on buildings yet-to-be-declared as earthquake-prone. Sale prices of currently-declared earthquake-prone commercial buildings in the suburbs also fell, but not as markedly. The sale probability of officially declared earthquake-prone buildings in Wellington rose markedly after the Christchurch earthquakes unlike the sale probability of yet-to-be-declared earthquake-prone buildings which fell slightly, reflecting buyer caution about such buildings. This pattern is indicative of forced sale of buildings following an official earthquake-prone declaration.},

Design/methodology/approach Through contingent valuation, this research aims to measure the propensity of homeowners to invest in the seismic security of their properties. The sample of homeowners was selected in a southern Italy city, which was characterized by a medium-high seismic hazard. The willingness to pay, once made independent from the family income, was compared with the actual cost of a seismic retrofitting technique to assess its cost-effectiveness. Findings The analysis developed on an example case shows that the economic sustainability of the intervention is only verified when considering the current tax incentives for this type of intervention. Practical implications Choosing to introduce a system to compulsory insurance against seismic risk could certainly be a strong incentive for the implementation of retrofitting interventions on private real estate assets. In this direction, investigations like this can be fundamental to establish the fair risk premium. Originality/value The need for effective seismic risk mitigation policies is also based on the growing awareness of the, often fatal, effects of seismic events, emphasized by the recent medium and high intensity events that hit Italy. The issue of the security of residential buildings is therefore a very topical issue in view of their high seismic vulnerability and the vast number of buildings requiring major seismic retrofitting. Therefore, the propensity of owners to intervene in improving the seismic performance of their properties can be crucial in seismic risk mitigation.},

Findings Wellington office market rents tend to increase with higher earthquake strength (New Building Standard) ratings, all other factors held equal. In contrast, rents in Auckland, a low-risk earthquake area, do not exhibit such price effects.

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse two questions. First, is there, and if so, how large is the price premium paid for a building exhibiting a cultural value? Second, are there any spillover effects of buildings with cultural values on sales prices of neighbouring houses? Design/methodology/approach Using a unique database of all buildings in the region of Halland, Sweden, combined with transaction data, hedonic models can be estimated, with spatially lagged variables describing proximity to three classes of culturally classified building – A, B and C – corresponding to building of national interest, building of regional interest and building of local interest. In addition, the authors also estimate models with a spatial specification on the error term, in an attempt to control for omitted variables. Findings The results indicate that cultural classification plays a role in determining the price of a property, with large effects (ranging between 36 and 60\% price premiums) for the highest classification. In addition, the authors find evidence of a cultural externality, houses in the vicinity of building with high cultural value sell at a small, but statistically significant premium of 1\%. Originality/value The cultural externality may be overlooked when it comes to valuation of cultural values in society, and therefore, it is likely that warranted protection acts to preserve cultural values in buildings become less than the social optimum. This paper suggests a new measure to cultural values contrasting previous research that rely on cultural preservation. This approach should limit problems with measurement errors that may lead to biased results.},

We find a statistically significant price penalty of around -9.6\% for houses protected for heritage values, between years 2006-2016. Yet, we also identify an external and local price premium, related to the number of heritage places around a house. This local density effect is approximately 1.7\% for an additional heritage place in a radius of 50 meters around the house, and decreases as the radius under analysis expands. We also find a price premium for a house located in Special Character Areas, for which the effect is positive and reaches 4.3\%.
