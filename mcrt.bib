  abstract = {We apply content analysis on government documents containing ecological information relevant to a significant ecological disturbance - mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks in the United States. The intent is to demonstrate a semi-automated approach that applies topic modeling to investigate policy responses to ecological disturbances, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), and term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) analysis. Results demonstrate how analysts and researchers are better able to understand what topics and focus areas government officials consider in relation to MPB disturbances. In the case study demonstrating the method’s utility, documents found from before 1960 and until recent years demonstrate focus on outbreak area, tree mortality, research and services, management, infestation, outbreak control, fire, insect control, outbreak factors, and tree population. Terms such as fire, mortality, treatment, and outbreak reflect more recent U.S. government focus on MPB, while disease and infestation have become less of a focus in recent years. There are also varying differences and interests between how different parts (i.e., federal agencies versus congress) of the U.S. government focus on MPB, where mostly interests and focus are not aligned or do not match temporally. As a term, temperature has become a greater recent government focus, but there is general avoidance of the term climate change. The methods applied demonstrate the utility of topic modeling and tf-idf for understanding discourse and content in policy related to ecological disturbances. The tool created in this effort is provided freely as a way for scientists and researchers to extend its utility in ecological policy research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Globalization, the process by which local social-ecological systems (SESs) are becoming linked in a global network, presents policy scientists and practitioners with unique and difficult challenges. Although local SESs can be extremely complex, when they become more tightly linked in the global system, complexity increases very rapidly as multi-scale and multi-level processes become more important. Here, we argue that addressing these multi-scale and multi-level challenges requires a collection of theories and models. We suggest that the conceptual domains of sustainability, resilience, and robustness provide a sufficiently rich collection of theories and models, but overlapping definitions and confusion about how these conceptual domains articulate with one another reduces their utility. We attempt to eliminate this confusion and illustrate how sustainability, resilience, and robustness can be used in tandem to address the multi-scale and multi-level challenges associated with global change.}

  abstract = {Adaptation to climate change in urban areas presents a complex challenge. Consequently, approaches to urban adaptation should be both multilevel and multidimensional. Community-based adaptation (CBA) presents an opportunity for local-level participation in framing adaptation planning and activities, with wider transformative potential for urban governance. This paper presents five case studies from cities in the Global South which offer insights into the different scales at which CBA can be mainstreamed in urban contexts, and the various ways in which this is happening. These examples demonstrate five emerging opportunities for mainstreaming urban CBA, which include using CBA as part of a wider package of approaches; seizing processes of institutional reform as an opportunity to integrate community perspectives; institutionalizing new actors and approaches as a mechanism for scaling up multi-stakeholder approaches; ensuring top-down planning approaches are connected to local dynamics; and using participatory research to facilitate local communities in shaping planning processes. The cases also demonstrate that while obstacles to mainstreaming in urban contexts remain, some lessons in addressing these challenges have emerged, and CBA should, therefore, be a part of the toolbox of local and national urban adaptation policy frameworks.},

The results show that the two analyses produce some similar and some complementary insights about the phenomenon of interest, in this case, nonuse of social media. We compare both the processes of conducting these analyses and the results they produce to derive insights about each method's unique advantages and drawbacks, as well as the broader roles that these methods play in the respective fields where they are often used. These insights allow us to make more informed decisions about the tradeoffs in choosing different methods for analyzing textual data. Furthermore, this comparison suggests ways that such methods might be combined in novel and compelling ways.},

The groundwork for the credibility initiates when the planning of the study begins. External and internal resources have to be identified, and the researcher must consider his or her experience of the phenomenon to be studied in order to minimize any bias of his/her own influence. The purpose of content analysis is to organize and elicit meaning from the data collected and to draw realistic conclusions from it. The researcher must choose whether the analysis should be of a broad surface structure (a manifest analysis) or of a deep structure (a latent analysis). Four distinct main stages are described in this paper: the decontextualisation, the recontextualisation, the categorization, and the compilation. This description of qualitative content analysis offers one approach that shows how the general principles of the method can be used.},

Although the literature on adaptation to climate change is rapidly expanding, little is known about the actual extent of implementation. We systematically screened {$>$}48,000 articles using machine learning methods and a global network of 126 researchers. Our synthesis of the resulting 1,682 articles presents a systematic and comprehensive global stocktake of implemented human adaptation to climate change. Documented adaptations were largely fragmented, local and incremental, with limited evidence of transformational adaptation and negligible evidence of risk reduction outcomes. We identify eight priorities for global adaptation research: assess the effectiveness of adaptation responses, enhance the understanding of limits to adaptation, enable individuals and civil society to adapt, include missing places, scholars and scholarship, understand private sector responses, improve methods for synthesizing different forms of evidence, assess the adaptation at different temperature thresholds, and improve the inclusion of timescale and the dynamics of responses.},

Studying climate change adaptation policy has become increasingly difficult, particularly given the increasing volume of potentially relevant data available, the validity of existing methods handling large volumes of data, and comprehensiveness of assessing processes of integration across all sectors and public sector organizations over time. This article explores the use of machine learning to assist researchers when conducting adaptation policy research using text as data. We briefly introduce machine learning for text analysis, present the steps of training and testing a neural network model to classify policy texts using data from the UK, and demonstrate its usefulness with quantitative and qualitative illustrations.

Several seeming knockout blows to communities will challenge the wisdom and affordability of resilience paradigms that have shaped policy and investment for civil works since Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. With extensive involvement of the public and lawmakers, mid-Atlantic US cities, New Orleans, and nearby coastal communities ultimately, and mostly successfully, opted to use pre-2005 civil works as the blueprint for future investment. Should options of returning to pre-event normalcy be considered for these latest devastated communities? What would gain and what will suffer? While there is continuing priority and commitment for infrastructure systems to be resilient, the theory, science and methodologies to do so will certainly be tested by recent events. Adoption of a resilience strategy by government agencies requires the wisdom of the emerging science of resilience as never before. We describe economic motivations for implementing resilience assessment and management in damaged communities and large scale complex systems. We describe the latest understood principles of resilience that drive a decision framework. We call for examination of risk-based policymaking and investment decisions by the science of resilience.},

Despite the advantages that computational methods have over traditional content analysis methods, they are not commonplace in digital journalism studies. To increase awareness of what computational methods have to offer, we take stock of the toolkit and show the ways in which computational methods can aid journalism studies.

  abstract = {Land-use control is local and highly varied. State agencies struggle to assess plan contents. Similarly, advocacy groups and planning researchers wrestle with the length of planning documents and ability to compare across plans. The goal of this research is to (1) introduce Natural Language Processing techniques that can automate qualitative coding in planning research and (2) provide policy-relevant exploratory findings. We assembled a database of 461 California city-level General Plans, extracted the text, and used topic modeling to identify areas of emphasis (clusters of co-occurring words). We find that California city general plans address more than sixty topics, including greenhouse gas mitigation and Climate Action Planning. Through spatializing results, we find that a quarter of the topics in plans are regionally specific. We also quantify the rift and convergence of planning topics. The topics focused on housing have very little overlap with other planning topics. This is likely a factor of state requirements to update and evolve the Housing Elements every five years, but not other aspects of General Plans. This finding has policy implications as housing topics evolve away from other emphasis areas such as transportation and economic development. Furthermore, the topic modeling approach reveals that many cities have had a focus on environmental justice through Health and Wellness Elements well before the state mandate in 2019. Our searchable state-level database of general plans is the first for California—and nationally. We provide a model for others that wish to comprehensively assess and compare plan contents using machine learning.},

Text-based documents account for a significant portion of data collected during the life cycle of asset management and the valuable information these documents contain is underutilized in analysis. Meanwhile, researchers historically design NLP pipelines with non-technical language in mind. This means industrial implementations are built on tools intended for non-technical use cases, suffering from a lack of verification, validation, and ultimately, personnel trust. To mitigate these sources of risk, we encourage a holistic, domain-driven approach to using NLP in a technical engineering setting, a paradigm we refer to as Technical Language Processing (TLP). Toward this end, the industrial asset management community must collectively redouble efforts toward production of and consensus around key domain-specific resources, including: (1) goal-driven data representations, (2) flexible entity type definitions and dictionaries, and (3) improved access to data-sets – raw and annotated. This collective action allows the maintenance community to follow in the path of other scientific communities, e.g., medicine, to develop and utilize these public resources to make TLP a key contributor to Industry 4.0.},

In particular, there is a need to focus not only on the vulnerability of our systems to failure, but also on our ability to manage and minimise the impact of any failures.  This raises some interesting concepts in terms of how we might design systems to be more resilient to change.  For example, the traditional engineering approach had been to design systems that are less vulnerable to damage from hazard events.  However system resilience can also be enhanced by increasing the adaptive capacity of the system, either through ensuring the system design includes enough redundancy to provide continuity of function, or through increasing the ability and speed of the system to evolve and adapt to new situations as they arise.  This paper discusses the particular challenges for evaluating the resilience of organisations to major hazard events.},

Many neural approaches to low-resource KE have been widely investigated and achieved impressive performance. In this paper, we present a literature review towards KE in low-resource scenarios, and systematically categorize existing works into three paradigms: (1) exploiting higher-resource data, (2) exploiting stronger models, and (3) exploiting data and models together. In addition, we highlight promising applications and outline some potential directions for future research. We hope that our survey can help both the academic and industrial communities to better understand this field, inspire more ideas, and boost broader applications.},

  abstract = {Resilience as a descriptive concept gives insight into the dynamic properties of an ecological-economic system. Sustainability as a normative concept captures basic ideas of intergenerational justice when human well-being depends on natural capital and services. Thus, resilience and sustainability are independent concepts. In this paper, we discuss the relationship between resilience and sustainability of ecological-economic systems. We use a simple dynamic model where two natural capital stocks provide ecosystem services that are complements for human well-being, to illustrate different possible cases of the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and to identify the conditions under which each of those will hold: a) resilience of the system is necessary, but not sufficient, for sustainability; b) resilience of the system is sufficient, but not necessary, for sustainability; c) resilience of the system is neither necessary nor sufficient for sustainability; and d) resilience is both necessary and sufficient for sustainability. We conclude that more criteria than just resilience have to be taken into account when designing policies for the sustainable development of ecological-economic systems, and, vice versa, the property of resilience should not be confused with the positive normative connotations of sustainability.},

  abstract = {We have entered the urban century and addressing a broad suite of sustainability challenges in urban areas is increasingly key for our chances to transform the entire planet towards sustainability. For example, cities are responsible for 70\% of global greenhouse gas emissions and, at the same time, 90\% of urban areas are situated on coastlines, making the majority of the world’s population increasingly vulnerable to climate change. While urbanization accelerates, meeting the challenges will require unprecedented transformative solutions for sustainability with a careful consideration of resilience in their implementation. However, global and local policy processes often use vague or narrow definitions of the concepts of ‘urban sustainability’ and ‘urban resilience’, leading to deep confusion, particularly in instances when the two are used interchangeably. Confusion and vagueness slow down needed transformation processes, since resilience can be undesirable and many sustainability goals contrast, or even challenge efforts to improve resilience. Here, we propose a new framework that resolves current contradictions and tensions; a framework that we believe will significantly help urban policy and implementation processes in addressing new challenges and contributing to global sustainability in the urban century.},

Communities across the globe are increasingly adopting goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption, address disaster safety, and improve overall housing health and quality. These goals, set by decision-making bodies, have historically been parsed into narrow strategies to be undertaken by individual agencies or departments. The result is a fragmented approach that misses co-benefit opportunities to advance efforts beyond single metrics. In California, there are untapped dividends in existing residential building upgrade programs that limit the benefit and scalability of resilience and sustainability initiatives. This article studies synergies among existing residential building upgrade initiatives by (1) exploring their complimentary outcomes, (2) recognizing the same buildings in need of seismic upgrades are also in need of other upgrades, and (3) recognizing the same policy levers and program structures for seismic retrofit are used for other existing building upgrade programs. By sharing overlaps and linkages between initiatives, program administrators can develop synergistic strategies that realize greater benefit across multiple metrics, provide professionals from each field entry points into others, and build a basis for a broader coalition for existing building upgrades.{$<$}br/{$>$} \&copy; 11th National Conference on Earthquake Engineering 2018, NCEE 2018: Integrating Science, Engineering, and Policy.

We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

However, when asking people about their state of mind in a natural context (“How are you?”), we receive open-ended answers using words (“Fine and happy!”) and not closed-ended answers using numbers (“7”) or categories (“A lot”). Nevertheless, to date it has been difficult to objectively quantify responses to open-ended questions. We develop an approach using open-ended questions in which the responses are analyzed using natural language processing (Latent Semantic Analyses). This approach of using open-ended, semantic questions is compared with traditional rating scales in nine studies (N = 92–854), including two different study paradigms. The first paradigm requires participants to describe psychological aspects of external stimuli (facial expressions) and the second paradigm involves asking participants to report their subjective well-being and mental health problems. The results demonstrate that the approach using semantic questions yields good statistical properties with competitive, or higher, validity and reliability compared with corresponding numerical rating scales. As these semantic measures are based on natural language and measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs, they have the potential of complementing and extending traditional rating scales.

  abstract = {Engineering competence and the digitization of all processes along the product development process are highly decisive for today’s success of industrial companies. The design process is very individual and strongly based on design engineers’ experience. Part of this knowledge and the result of the design approach are fixated in the existing variations of the product generations, but are difficult to extract and to formalize. Conclusions about design-related patterns between products of different generations or variants can be drawn from the model tree representing the design engineer’s thinking process for each individual CAD model. However, the model tree has hardly been used so far. The aim of this paper is to examine whether there exist any common design patterns between CAD models of certain component classes by the exemplary use case in the area of mechanical engineering. To identify patterns and to extract knowledge out of complex data sets, Machine Learning (ML), especially Deep Learning, has proven an immense capability. Finally, based on the learned patterns, meaningful next design steps are to be proposed in the form of an assistance system. The results show that there exist common design patterns for various classes of components. It is illustrated on an exemplary component class that those patterns can be used to train an assistance system based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The corresponding design patterns were extracted from data of an industrial application partner. By transferring these design patterns to the development of new product generations or variants, on the one hand the design process itself and thus the time to market can be shortened. On the other hand, the knowledge from previous product generations contained in those patterns can be preserved. For further research the design patterns of CAD models extracted by ML algorithms is a contribution to faster knowledge extrapolation.},

Psychologists have shown increasing interest in such models, comparing their output to psychological judgments such as similarity, association, priming, and comprehension, raising the question of whether the models could serve as psychological theories. In this article, we compare how humans and machines represent the meaning of words. We argue that contemporary NLP systems are fairly successful models of human word similarity, but they fall short in many other respects. Current models are too strongly linked to the text-based patterns in large corpora, and too weakly linked to the desires, goals, and beliefs that people express through words. Word meanings must also be grounded in perception and action and be capable of flexible combinations in ways that current systems are not. We discuss promising approaches to grounding NLP systems and argue that they will be more successful, with a more human-like, conceptual basis for word meaning.

  abstract = {Sustainability has been a core conceptual framework for community development since the approach was popularized in 1987, although in its essence it reflects a long history of environmental conservation reactions to industrialization. Resilience, as a framework for understanding and approaching community development, emerged more gradually out of ecological studies in the 1980s, but has only recently, since the mid-2000s, emerged as a focus of public interest as a way of responding and adapting to the planet's growing anthropogenic changes. For many, sustainability and resilience are slightly nuanced perspectives on the same phenomenon. For others, however, there are distinct differences between them, with sustainability's conservation goals being in opposition to the adaptation goals of resilience. Two major reasons for these confusions are (1) both concepts are defined and used in many different ways to achieve a variety of political goals that may not reflect their core definitions, and (2) both concepts share similar goals and some common approaches, such as a focus on climate change and seeking a balance between humans and nature. Returning to the core definitions of conservation and adaptation helps to clarify their similarities and differences, as well as to articulate indicators for understanding how each applies to community tourism development. Indicators from research in rural Taiwan tourism communities were therefore based on responses to the questions: What does the community want to conserve and how do they want to do it (sustainability)? What do they want to change and how do they want to do it (resilience)? Preliminary results suggest that the new ideal community is the one that is both sustainable and resilient.},

To investigate similarities, differences, and current management frameworks for increasing sustainability and resilience, a literature review was undertaken that focused on integrated use of sustainability and resilience in an environmental management context. Sustainability was defined through the triple bottom line of environmental, social and economic system considerations. Resilience was viewed as the ability of a system to prepare for threats, absorb impacts, recover and adapt following persistent stress or a disruptive event. Three generalized management frameworks for organizing sustainability and resilience were found to dominate the literature: (1) resilience as a component of sustainability, (2) sustainability as a component of resilience, and (3) resilience and sustainability as separate objectives. Implementations of these frameworks were found to have common goals of providing benefits to people and the environment under normal and extreme operating conditions, with the best examples building on similarities and minimizing conflicts between resilience and sustainability.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. It has become common for sustainability science and resilience theory to be considered as complementary approaches. Occasionally the terms have been used interchangeably. Although these two approaches share some working principles and objectives, they also are based on some distinct assumptions about the operation of systems and how we can best guide these systems into the future. Each approach would benefit from some scholars keeping sustainability science and resilience theory separate and focusing on further developing their distinctiveness and other scholars continuing to explore them in combination. Three areas of research in which following different procedures might be beneficial are whether to prioritize outcomes or system dynamics, how best to take advantage of community input, and increasing the use of knowledge of the past as a laboratory for potential innovations.}

We present an alternative, semiautomated approach, the structural topic model (STM) (Roberts, Stewart, and Airoldi 2013; Roberts et al. 2013), that draws on recent developments in machine learning based analysis of textual data. A crucial contribution of the method is that it incorporates information about the document, such as the author's gender, political affiliation, and treatment assignment (if an experimental study). This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects. We illustrate these innovations with analysis of text from surveys and experiments.},

  abstract = {Every year, the United States is faced with billions of dollars in damages and large numbers of deaths due to natural hazards. Resilience to these hazards has become a growing theme in sustainable design and the current global discourse on climate change adaptation. Coping with the challenges of earth's ever-shifting climate contextualizes the importance of resilience in sustainable development. To achieve greater resilience at a minimum environmental cost, the literature suggests developing a coherent sustainability and resilience framework. This review discusses the definition of sustainability and resilience and the relationship between the two concepts in order to examine the possibility of establishing such a combined framework. Studying the relationship between the sustainability and resilience points to some similarities between the two paradigms but also highlights key differences that may impede their integration. Most existing studies advocate the incorporation of resilience indicators into sustainability metrics and believe it to be technically possible. The major finding of this review is that the integration process requires developing a new combined assessment tool or a thorough refinement of current sustainability frameworks to include resilience indicators that were not initially included. For such a unified framework to be established successfully, the active involvement of different stakeholders in all stages is necessary.},

  abstract = {Issues related to sustainable urbanisation are best addressed when coordinated within a strategic framework and facilitated by a system of policy formulation that combines local opinions with scientific insights. This implies that planning for sustainable urbanisation has the potential to minimise climate change threats. While there is a pressing need for this potential to be realised globally, the current level of success in fast growing cities of the developing world is very limited. An approach to overcome this limitation has recently been successful in Dhaka, one of the fastest growing global megacities. It involved the identification of a strategic framework for the city. This framework was then combined with a locally-informed model of sustainable urbanisation to produce the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Planning Support System (DMDPSS). This paper discusses the climate change adaptation and mitigation issues that can be addressed through such a method in Dhaka, using a scenario-based approach. Two alternative development options (constrained and unconstrained) are constructed and analysed. A common set of indicators are used: first to evaluate which alternative is more sustainable; and then the mitigation and adaptation issues addressed. Results show that the ‘constrained’ scenario, which includes a series of development limitations, is both more sustainable and can address more mitigation and adaptation issues than the other alternative. The scenario analysis, however, is only a part of the strategic framework needed for Dhaka. Indeed other factors, such as dissemination of facts and issues, and the ease and equity of communication in the community, are critical both for progress towards sustainability and to enhance community resilience to climate change. The paper concludes that the optimum combination of adaptation and mitigation measures can be identified in fast growing cities by using systems, such as the DMDPSS, based on the core principles of sustainable development.},

We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. In addition to its theoretical contribution to scientific research on sustainable artificial intelligence in energy management, the research utilizes a novel topic modeling method in exploring scientific texts and identifying challenges and possible solutions. A variety of solutions was incorporated, including huggingface tool or elbow method, to address these challenges.},

We set out to extend the functionality provided by CiteSeer through an investigation of clustering by topic similarity, experimenting with visualization and summary of clustering results. We had three main goals in mind. First, we hoped to develop a sensible clustering of the articles based on textual similarity. In doing so, we ended up using CiteSeer’s similarity results as partial input to our clusterer. Second, we hoped to provide a meaningful visualization of some of the topics represented in the article corpus. Finally, we wanted to investigate the possibility of automatically naming each cluster given the features present in each article and the article’s similarity to the closest centroid. With such a large pool of articles, we felt that automatic generation would be preferable to a hand-crafted taxonomy.},

However, to make analysis of large sets of responses practical, most surveys use a closed-response format with a small set of potential responses. Open-ended formats, such as written free response, can provide deeper insights into student thinking, but take much longer to analyze, especially with a large number of responses. Here, we explore natural language processing as a computational solution to this problem. We create a machine learning model that can take student responses from the Physics Measurement Questionnaire as input, and output a categorization of student reasoning based on different reasoning paradigms. Our model yields classifications with the same level of agreement as that between two humans categorizing the data, but can be done by a computer, and thus can be scaled for large datasets. In this work, we describe the algorithms and methodologies used to create, train, and test our natural language processing system. We also present the results of the analysis and discuss the utility of these approaches for analyzing open-response data in education research.},

The lack of empirical studies on resilience policies hinders our ability to develop theory, ask new questions, and test hypotheses. The goal of this paper is to quantify and compare policies and programs of the 101 largest cities in the U.S. that tangibly affect resilience. We develop a set of resilience policies and then search government websites for evidence of adoption of those policies. To explore patterns of policy adoption, we conduct factor analysis and correlation. We find that resilience does not coalesce around any particular sets of programs. Instead, resilience is a flexible concept, modified to address local context. Substantive groupings of policies do not explain policy adoption. Different dimensions such as funding and level of needed commitment may better explain empirical patterns of policy adoption. Across cities, greater attention must be dedicated to addressing drivers of social vulnerability and climate change impacts. By examining what cities are doing and whether there are underlying patterns to the policies they pursue, we tackle basic empirical questions of how to make sense of the evolving resilience landscape.},

However, existing studies tended to extract and analyze knowledge from a single perspective (e.g., the number of certain knowledge types and knowledge structures), which failed to demonstrate the complexity and dynamics of knowledge construction and advancement. To fill this gap, this research designed a series of computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) activities to facilitate students’ CKC process and then used an integrated approach (i.e., semantic knowledge analysis combined with learning analytics) to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge characteristics and evolutionary trends. Results demonstrated that compared to the low-performing pairs, the high-performing pairs mainly discussed knowledge related to the course content, and their knowledge evolution trend was relatively stable. Based on the results, this research provided analytical implications to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge and pedagogical implications to promote students’ knowledge construction and advancement.},

  abstract = {The past literatures have studied both ‘urban resilience (UR)’ and ‘urban sustainability (US)’ in terms of the dual character - vulnerability and pertinacity - of cities. However, there is a large overlap between the meaning of resilience and sustainability, which threatens to weaken both concepts. In this study, we discuss the difference between urban resilience (UR) and urban sustainability (US) from three aspects of research trends, research scale and research clusters. CiteSpace 4.0.R5 is used for co-citation analysis, visualizing co-citation networks and research clusters. UR and US studies contrast in not only their different theoretical bases, but also even more in their empirical work. A conceptual framework is proposed to define the difference between UR and US, and four kinds of urban development are examined based on the framework. We indicate that rational urban development can be achieved only when it is both resilient and sustainable, and conclude that urban planners, policymakers and researchers should pay equal attention to both UR and US before decision-making.},

  abstract = {In this poster session, we share our work exploring the use of natural language processing (NLP) to assist in the thematic analysis of qualitative data. With the affordances currently provided by artificial intelligence and machine learning to process textual data for meaning, our interdisciplinary team of computer and social science researchers is using a data set of open-ended text responses to test procedures for creating thematic categories to organize participant responses by content. By comparing parallel analyses of our text corpus using traditional and NLP thematic-analysis techniques, we identify key areas of congruity and incongruity between human analysts and NLP algorithms. While the areas of congruity point to the potential usefulness of NLP systems in qualitative research, the areas of incongruity suggest the need for a “human in the loop” NLP platform which iteratively refines the content analysis outputs based on feedback from an expert researcher until a satisfactorily coherent thematic description is achieved.},
